Event Extraction and Clustering for Israel-Hamas Conflict

Introduction
In this document, we describe a methodology for extracting and clustering events related to the Israel-Hamas conflict from a dataset of news articles. The goal is to identify and visualize key events in the conflict timeline using natural language processing (NLP) and clustering techniques.

Methodology
1. Dataset Loading and Inspection
Import necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy) and load the dataset from a JSON file.
Examine the dataset structure and content to understand the available fields and their formats.

2. Data Preprocessing
Extract relevant fields such as article body, date modified, scraped date, source, and title.
Perform any necessary data cleaning, such as removing duplicates or handling missing values.

3. Title Vectorization Using SpaCy
Utilize the SpaCy library to vectorize the titles of the news articles.
Vectorization converts textual data into numerical vectors, which can be used for clustering.

4. Clustering with DBSCAN
Apply the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to cluster the vectorized titles.
Experiment with different epsilon values to determine the optimal parameter for clustering.

5. Scatter Plot Visualization of Clusters
Create a scatter plot to visualize the clusters generated by the DBSCAN algorithm.
The scatter plot helps in understanding the distribution and separation of clusters in the vector space.

6. Event Extraction Based on Keywords
Extract events related to the Israel-Hamas conflict using specific keywords such as "Israel," "Hamas," and "war."
Identify sentences or articles containing these keywords as potential events.

7. Filtering and Presentation of Events
Organize the extracted events into a DataFrame, including dates and descriptions of events.
Sort the events chronologically to create a timeline of key events in the conflict.
Use Plotly to present the events in an interactive and visually appealing manner.


Conclusion
This methodology demonstrates how NLP and clustering techniques can be used to extract and visualize key events from a dataset of news articles. By applying these techniques, we can gain insights into the timeline and nature of the Israel-Hamas conflict, providing a valuable tool for researchers and analysts studying the conflict.
