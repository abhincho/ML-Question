    "## Create a timeline summarization list, that shows the major events of the IsraelHamas war that had occurred during the time-period mentioned in the Json file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps followed Thought process\n",
    "- Loading and Preprocessing the json data.\n",
    "- Taking the input from the user like Israel-Hamas War and Generating the keywords\n",
    "- Extract the date and the news article description\n",
    "- Summarize the description using the llm model (here, used the facebook/bart-large-cnn for text summary generation)\n",
    "- generate the vector embeddings for each article(i.e. description) and then form clusters of the similar articles(i.e. description) by means of some clustering algorithm (here, used DBSCAN)\n",
    "- Using the keywords filter the articles based on the description and then get a central vector which respresent all the filtered articles via keywords, now based on the central vector find a cluster that it belongs to based on all the data and corseponding to the vector get all the articles\n",
    "- get the date corresponding to these articles and that will your results\n",
    "- further summarize the articels by forming the cluster and using title or description to generate new title or desciption for a enchaned summary like mentioned in the problem document \"An example of a time timeline summarization list is as follows (excerpt from Wikipedia):\". "

The three military observers were unarmed, he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnifil is “investigating the origin of the explosion” but it was difficult to put investigators on the ground immediately because of the ongoing exchange of fire, added Tenenti.\\n\\n“Safety and security of UN personnel must be guaranteed,” Tenenti said, urging “all actors to cease the current heavy exchanges of fire before more people are unnecessarily hurt.”\\n\\nA UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said António Guterres condemned the explosion and expressed “grave concern” at the daily exchanges of fire between armed groups in Lebanon and Israeli forces.\\n\\n“These hostile actions have not only disrupted the livelihoods of thousands of people, but they also pose a grave threat to the security and stability of Lebanon, Israel, and the region,” Dujarric said.\\n\\n\\n\\nGuterres urges all action to refrain from further violations of the 2006 cessation of hostilities “and to pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis”, Dujarric said, adding that the UN chief stands ready to support such efforts.\\n\\n\\n\\nLebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati also condemned the incident in a statement.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnifil was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel’s 1978 invasion.\\n\\nThe UN expanded its mission after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to deploy along the Israeli border to help the Lebanese military extend its authority into the country’s south for the first time in decades.\\n\\nWith Associated Press, Australian Associated Press and Agence France-Presse\",\n",

    "  \"articleBody\": \"Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha recently found himself amid a political storm after British Labour Party MP Preet Kaur Gill posted on social media about their meeting in London last week to discuss “global health security”.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Union Minister Anurag Thakur targeted the AAP without naming Chadha. “What kind of government is it (in Punjab)? An MP from the state (Punjab) stands with those forces who speak against India and support terrorism. He poses for a picture with them wearing a smile on his face. The AAP did not react to the BJP’s criticism of Chadha’s UK visit and his meeting with the Labour MP.\\n\\nGreat to meet @raghav_chadha in Parliament. – He is a Rajya Sabha MP from Punjab, India. I look forward to a discussion around global health security and antimicrobial resistance. pic.twitter.com/9Gz6gc7TZi — Preet Kaur Gill MP (@PreetKGillMP) March 20, 2024\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGill, the Shadow Minister for Primary Care and Public Health, made history in 2017 when she became the first woman Sikh MP of the United Kingdom. She has also often drawn scrutiny from the Indian government due to her perceived support for Khalistan.\\n\\nThe 51-year-old chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for British Sikhs and serves as Vice Chair for the APPG on International Freedom of Religion or Belief. In February, she alleged in the House of Commons that agents with ties to India were targeting Sikhs in the UK. Gill mentioned that some British Sikhs were even on a “hit list” of what she termed “transnational repression”, and questioned Security Minister Tom Tugendhat about the British government’s response.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn August 2020, Gill engaged in a public row on X (at the time, Twitter) with Conservative British MP Raminder Singh Ranger who posted that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson does not endorse Khalistan. Gill promptly challenged him citing the principle of self-determination enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\\n\\nThe eldest of seven siblings, Preet Gill was born to a bus driver father and seamstress mother at Edgbaston, Birmingham, in 1972. Her father Dalvir Singh Shergill who migrated from the village of Jamsher in Jalandhar to West Midlands in 1962 was known as much for his height — he was a towering 6’4” — as for his work as the president of the first gurdwara in the UK — the Guru Nanak Gurdwara in Smethwick — from 1984 to 2004.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPreet Gill had her first taste of public life when she was elected college president of Bournville College, where she studied psychology and sociology. She moved to London to get an honours degree in sociology and social work from the University of East London and became a child services manager. After completing her post-graduation, Gill came to India where she spent some time working with street children in Delhi. She also lived in a kibbutz in Israel for some time.\\n\\nGill’s parliamentary tenure\\n\\nA very active parliamentarian, Gill is known for her work in public health and environment. She first incurred the ire of the Indian authorities when she called for the release of British national Jagtar Singh Johal, aka Jaggi Johal, who she claimed was being wrongly held and tortured by the police since 2017, the year she was elected MP from Edgbaston, Birmingham. It is one demand she has raised every now and then. Arrested while on a visit to Punjab in 2017, Johal is accused of being involved in targeted killings in Punjab and at present is in Delhi’s Tihar jail.\\n\\nPreet Gill is still known to maintain her ties with her extended family in Jamsher, where a celebration was held to commemorate her victory in 2017. Around that time she triggered a row when during a visit to Punjab after her election she expressed concern about the prevalence of drugs, a no-go topic for foreign delegates. She also seemed to endorse the year-long farmers’ protest in 2020-’21 against the now-repealed farm laws.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn December 2021, soon after a sacrilege and lynching incident at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the Indian High Commission in Britain issued a statement slamming Gill when she first wrote and then deleted a post that referred to a “Hindu terrorist” behind the act. Later she posted, “Beadbi incidents are unacceptable but the lynching of another person is also unacceptable.”\\n\\nIn 2023, Gill triggered a row in the Sikh community when she defended faith leaders amid a debate on domestic abuse among Sikh women sparked by a report from Sikh Women’s Aid. The report surveyed 839 Sikh women in Britain, revealing that nearly two-thirds had experienced domestic abuse, including incidents involving faith leaders. Gill took to the WhatsApp group “Sikhs in Labour” to seek a written apology to the “guru ghars”.\\n\\nOf late, Gill has been at the receiving end of threats, which started coming last year when she got a threatening email. In January, she told BBC that people had been threatening to protest outside her home. “I am really worried in a way I have never been worried before,” she told the broadcaster.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe Labour leader is married to fellow social worker Sureash Arora, with whom she has two daughters aged 12 and 14.\",\n",
