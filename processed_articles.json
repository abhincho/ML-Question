    "articleBody": "The hype over artificial intelligence is starting to fade. One of the sobering realizations was that training such large language models (LLM) bolsters personal data protection concerns. These concerns were already heightened by the increasing data usage in business, which had led to regulations such as the EU\u2019s GDPR and California\u2019s CCPA.\n\nFreely using public web data to create AI-based products and services has also raised pressing copyright and data ownership issues, resulting in a number of legal suits filed in 2023. These suits include a copyright infringement case against OpenAI for using 300,000 books to train its model, another lawsuit against Stability AI for using images and metadata owned by Getty, as well as a case against Github\u2019s Copilot for republishing code, among others.\n\n3 Legal Questions Facing AI in 2024 Who owns the data that AI relies on for training? How should data creators be compensated for the use of their data? What impact will AI law in the EU and U.S. have on AI development?\n\nSome of the questions raised by those cases might be answered in courts as early as 2024. Lawsuits against AI firms and a web data collection provider should give us a clearer view of those areas.\n\nThe changes in regulation that such case law and public scrutiny will bring are bound to have an effect on how AI and automated data gathering develop in the future. Some trends and directions are already shaping up.\n\nWhat Are the Main Legal and Ethical Questions Facing AI?\n\nIn terms of web data collection, ongoing legal battles manifest all the main issues at hand. It\u2019s a question of who owns the data. Social media sites will argue that as they allow posting users information, it\u2019s in the interest of the users to have it protected from being collected and sold. Scraping services might answer that data made public is fair game for everyone, and it\u2019s not up to social media giants to restrict access to it but rather for the users themselves to decide whether they allow their data to be gathered and for what purposes.\n\nImportantly, the previous argument is limited to the data that is publicly available and accessible without logging into an account, which brings us to the second point. Creating accounts and logging in will mean agreeing to the site\u2019s terms and conditions, which will usually ban bot activity and scraping. Thus, social media companies will argue breach of such accepted terms and conditions, which has been among the main arguments that kept scraping at bay.\n\nOnce again, there is a question of whether social media platforms are justified in limiting access to the data in this way since they don\u2019t own the data created by users either. Here, user opinions might differ on whether social media sites are protecting their data or appropriating it by limiting public access to it.\n\nFinally, there is a special concern regarding the data of minors. This is what a proposed class action lawsuit accuses a data provider in Israel, where selling data of minors is explicitly prohibited.\n\nSince the training of LLMs and AI development are dependent on scraped data, AI faces the same legal issues. It\u2019s all about data privacy, ownership and how, if at all, data creators should be compensated for their products being used to train machine learning algorithms that go on to produce something else.\n\nMore on AIData Privacy Laws Every Company Should Know\n\nWill AI Development Halt in 2024?\n\nEarlier this year, there was a call from 1,000 tech leaders to pause AI development for at least six months until we can better understand it. What motivated the open letter was the lack of regulation and multiple unknowns related to how AI works and develops. Now, it might seem like their plea is going to be answered to some extent due to the aforementioned legal and ethical concerns. However, it\u2019s highly unlikely that regulation will seriously halt all AI development in the near future.\n\nAlthough legal battles might temporarily delay the evolution of generative AI and tools based on machine learning, in the long run, clear regulation should give direction to the field. This can boost focused progress.\n\nAdditionally, there are other emerging techniques in the field that might offer much-needed technological breakthroughs. These include federated machine learning and causal AI, which might prove to be a step forward from only superficially intelligent generative systems.\n\nFederated learning is a framework that allows training machine learning algorithms without direct access to users\u2019 personal data, solving the pressing issues of data privacy and isolated data islands.\n\nCausal AI, on the other hand, offers hope to solve the problem of predictive models hallucinating strange outcomes due to failing to grasp causal relations. Generative AI falls short of objectivity and accuracy because it equates correlation with causation. Causal AI functions more like the human mind, asking such questions as \u201cwhat if\u201d and examining the possible relationships between cause and effect. This could make AI more reliable.\n\nThis allows the hope for successfully deploying such models in a broad range of use cases, for example, analyzing health data to assist in diagnosing and prevention. And it shows that AI still has a lot of room for development, even as we wait for broadening regulation.\n\nIs General Web Scraping Regulation Coming?\n\nWhen faced with the challenges of personal data protection in a highly digitalized society, the EU introduced GDPR as a general framework. After working on it since 2021 and being blindsided by generative AI models in 2022, the EU seems to have agreed on the foundational rules for the first comprehensive AI law as 2023 closes.\n\nThe law will distinguish between different risk levels of AI models, banning those that are considered unacceptable and requiring transparency from tools like ChatGPT. In the U.S., President Joe Biden released an executive order outlining new standards for AI safety and innovation that could set the policy direction for federal agencies on AI.\n\nDoes this pave the way for a general web scraping regulation as well? It\u2019s unlikely that we will see it any time soon, much less in 2024. Web scraping has many crucial applications, ranging from making Google and other search engines possible to driving investigative journalism and research across various fields, including AI.\n\nIt\u2019s more likely that we will see more laws targeting specific illegitimate applications of web scraping infrastructure. For example, there are calls for expanding the BOTS Act that bans using automated solutions for ticketing.\n\nAdditionally, we might see broader adoption of tools and regulations like the Delete Act of California, going into power with the start of the new year. The act mandates regulators to create a tool allowing consumers to issue a single request to stop all data brokers registered in the state from storing and collecting their data.\n\nMore on AIHow Web Scraping Is Shaping the Future of Machine Learning\n\nHow Will These Lawsuits Impact AI in 2024?\n\nSome mentioned regulatory changes may have effects within months, while lawsuits might take years to complete and establish mandatory rules, which isn\u2019t even a given. In most cases, we will have to wait and see what exact changes it will bring to the data gathering industry, AI that depends on it, and the users of these services.\n\nWhat we can expect is that case law and clearly defined rules will weed out the abusers of web scraping or force them to change. While it might bring internal chaos to some service providers, in the long run, it will hopefully stabilize both AI and data collection industries.",

May have moved to Dubai but its disgraceful sanctioning of Usman Khawaja for daring to proclaim \u201c all lives matter\u201d smacks of the haughty out of touch 19 th century views of the Long Room at Lords. \u2014 Paul Bongiorno (@PaulBongiorno) December 22, 2023\n\nHis next attempt \u2013 printing a dove and an olive branch on his bat and shoes \u2013 was also blocked by the ICC with a spokesperson for cricket\u2019s world governing body being quoted by ESPNCricinfo as saying that \u201cpersonal messages of this nature are not allowed as per Clause F of the Clothing and Equipment Regulations\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ICC is supportive of players using their platforms outside of the playing arena to promote human rights, peace and equality and would encourage him to continue to use alternative platforms,\u201d the ICC spokesperson added.\n\nKhawaja said the logo, a reference to Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was approved by Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers\u2019 Association.\n\n\u201cI respect the ICC and the rules and regulations they have. I will be asking them and contesting they make it fair and equitable for everyone and they have consistency in how they officiate,\u201d Khawaja said on Friday. \u201cThat consistency hasn\u2019t been done yet. I was very open and honest with that. I\u2019ll deal with that with the ICC.\u201d\n\nSimply ridiculous.https://t.co/WcKeU2sBEJ The ICC has denied Usman Khawaja's latest attempt to raise awareness of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza by knocking back his application to display the image of a dove and an olive branch on his bat and shoes. \u2014 Sushant Singh (@SushantSin) December 24, 2023\n\nIn 2014, England all-rounder Moeen Ali was banned by the ICC from wearing wristbands featuring the slogans \u201cSave Gaza\u201d and \u201cFree Palestine\u201d.\n\nHowever, in 2019, Indian cricketers wore army camouflage-style caps in a match against Australia in solidarity with Indian paramilitary police killed in an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe ICC also allowed players to \u201ctake the knee\u201d before international matches in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 and 2021.\n\nUsman Khawaja charged by ICC for wearing a simple black armband in support of children in Gaza but the whole Indian team wearing army caps apparently had nothing to do with political/personal messages.

Once again, they show their hypocrisy and lack of moral standing as an organisation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ICC regulations say re messaging \u2018approval shall not be granted for messages which relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes\u2019, so how were people allowed to take the knee for BLM and stumps were covered with LGBTQ colours?\u201d\n\nWhether you support Usman Khawaja\u2019s stance or not the inconsistencies of the ICC are hard to fathom Marnus Labuschagne has an eagle & bible verse on his bat WI\u2019s Nicholas Pooran has a cross and the word \u2018believe\u2019 on his bat Seems a scatter gun approach re what\u2019s allowed https://t.co/h0shoJ4yke \u2014 Glenn Mitchell (@MitchellGlenn) December 24, 2023\n\nAustralian captain Pat Cummins also backed Khawaja\u2019s stance and show of support while questioning the ICC\u2019s lack of clarity over rules that allow players to show support for such causes.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s standing up for what he believes and I think he\u2019s doing it really respectfully. All lives are equal and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very offensive, and I\u2019d say the same about the dove,\u201d said Cummins.\n\nIsrael launched an all-out attack on Gaza after the October 7 attack by Hamas.

No Christmas tree, no decorations, no family dinner, no celebrations,\" he said while undergoing dialysis. \"I pray for this war to be over soon.\"\n\nSister Nabila Salah from the Catholic Holy Church in Gaza -- where two Christian women were killed by an Israeli sniper earlier this month according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem -- struck a sombre tone.\n\n\"All Christmas celebrations have been cancelled,\" she told AFP. \"How do we celebrate when we are... hearing the sound of tanks and bombardment instead of the ringing of bells?\"\n\nThe war broke out when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel on October 7 and killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, and seized 250 hostages, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nIsrael has vowed to eliminate Hamas in response and its military campaign, which has included massive aerial bombardment, has killed 20,424 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.\n\nPope Francis kicked off global Christmas celebrations on Sunday with a call for peace, as the war cast a shadow over one of the world's favourite holidays.\n\n\"Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,\" the Catholic leader said.\n\nThe Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, arrived Sunday at the Church of the Nativity, clad in the traditional black and white keffiyeh.\n\n\"Our heart goes to Gaza, to all people in Gaza but a special attention to our Christian community in Gaza who is suffering,\" he said.\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry said at least 70 people were killed in an Israeli air strike on Sunday at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza.\n\nHealth ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said the \"toll is likely to rise\" as many families were thought to be in the area at the time of the strike.\n\nIn a separate incident, the ministry said 10 members of one family were killed in an Israeli strike on their house in the Jabalia camp in northern Gaza.\n\nAFP was unable to independently verify either toll.\n\nVast areas of Gaza lie in ruins and its 2.4 million people have endured dire shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine due to an Israeli siege, alleviated only by the limited arrival of aid trucks.\n\nEighty percent of Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN, many fleeing south and now shielding against the winter cold in makeshift tents.\n\nThe head of the UN refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, urged an end to the suffering in the third month of the war.\n\n\"A humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is the only way forward,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"War defies logic and humanity, and prepares a future of more hatred and less peace.\"\n\nAnd World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus similarly renewed calls for a ceasefire, saying: \"The decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy.\"\n\nThe Jordanian army said its air force had air dropped aid to about 800 people sheltering at the Church of Saint Porphyrius in northern Gaza.\n\nThe war was exacting a \"very heavy price\", Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday, as the death toll of soldiers killed in the conflict continued to mount.\n\n\"But we have no choice but to keep fighting,\" he said, adding: \"This will be a long war.\"\n\nAnother soldier was killed on Sunday, the army said, taking to 15 the number of troops killed since Friday and 154 since Israel's ground assault began on October 27.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus indicated that forces were close to gaining control in northern Gaza and that now \"we focus our efforts against Hamas in southern Gaza\".\n\nTwo freed detainees and a medic said Sunday that Palestinians held by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip had suffered torture, a charged denied by the military.\n\nThe two men were among hundreds detained by Israeli forces over alleged links with Hamas during Israel's ground offensive.",

    "articleBody": "The year 2023 proved to be a noteworthy period marked by several significant global events. From the wrestlers' protest to the breach of Parliament security, there were numerous major headlines.\n\nIn the context of India, the year was particularly memorable, highlighted by the success of Chandrayaan-3 and the successful organization of the G20 summit. Check out the list:\n\nWrestlers Protest\n\nThe first major event to hit headlines in 2023 was top wrestlers such as Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik, joining a protest at Jantar Mantar in Delhi, calling for action against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over sexual harassment allegations.\n\n2023 Turkey-Syria earthquakes\n\nOn 6 February, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern and central Turkey and northern and western It was followed by a 7.7 magnitude earthquake, causing widespread damage and tens of thousands of fatalities.\n\nManish Sisodia Arrested\n\nDelhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia was arrested on February by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) after he was questioned for about nine hours in connection with alleged corruption in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped liquor policy in the national capital.\n\nBJP Wins Northeast\n\nThe BJP successfully retained its iron grip on the northeastern states in the March assembly elections, by winning both Tripura and Nagaland. In Meghalaya, BJP went solo this time and managed to win 5 seats.\n\nRahul Gandhi Disqualified\n\nFormer Congress president Rahul Gandhi was on Friday disqualified from Lok Sabha following his conviction by a Surat court in a 2019 criminal defamation case.\n\nAtiq Ahmad Shot Dead\n\nGangster-turned-politician Atiq Ahmad and his brother Ashraf were shot dead at point-blank range by three men posing as journalists in the middle of a media interaction in April while police personnel were escorting them to a medical college here for a checkup.\n\nAmritpal Singh Arrested\n\nRadical preacher Amritpal Singh was arrested from Punjab's Moga in April. Singh had been on the run since March 18 when a police crackdown was launched against him and his outfit 'Waris Punjab De'.\n\nCongress Dethrones BJP In Karnataka\n\nThe Congress returned to power on its own in Karnataka after 10 years, knocking the BJP off its only southern perch. It emerged victorious in the 224-member Karnataka Assembly polls by winning 135 seats.\n\nManipur Violence\n\nIn a shocking incident, two women were stripped and paraded naked on May 4. A video of the incident came to light on July 19. This incident hogged global headlines.\n\nNew Parliament Building\n\nPrime Minister Narendra on May 28 inaugurated the new Parliament building. It was a mega-event, in which many took part.\n\nOdisha Train Accident\n\nA horrific train accident in Balasore district in Odisha on June 2. The incident took the lives of 296. The accident occurred when 22 compartments of the Coromandel Express derailed following a collision with a stationary goods train. Three of the derailed coaches were propelled onto adjacent tracks, colliding with some compartments of the Bengaluru-Howrah superfast express.\n\nOpposition Bloc Formed\n\nTo take on the mighty BJP, the like-minded parties united and formed a bloc called INDIA in July. So far, four meetings have been held, but the union of 28 parties is yet to announce the PM candidate.\n\nChandrayaan\n\nIn a giant leap for its space programme, India's Moon mission Chandrayaan-3 touched down on the lunar south pole in August, propelling the country to an exclusive club of four and making it the first country to land on the uncharted surface.\n\nWith this touchdown on the Moon to script history after a flawless 41-day voyage and less than a week after a Russian lander headed to the lunar south pole crashed, India has become the fourth country to master the technology of soft-landing on the Moon after the US, China and the erstwhile Soviet Union\n\nG20 Summit\n\nIndia successfully hosted the G20 Summit in September. The top leaders of the world attended the event.\n\nGaza Attack\n\nHamas launched the operation Al-Aqsa Storm' by firing thousands of rockets into Israel on October 7. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters infiltrated Israel by land, sea and air. The war has not ended yet.\n\nIndia Loses World Cup Final\n\nAfter winning 11 matches in a row, the Men in Blue lost the World Cup final played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in 2023. This was one of major upsets in the sports.\n\nUttarakhand Tunnel Collapse\n\n41 construction workers were trapped in an under-construction tunnel in Uttarakhand's Uttarkashi district after it collapsed on November 12. The challenging rescue operation concluded on 16th day after pulling out all the trapped workers.\n\nBJP Wins Heartland\n\nThe BJP emerged victorious in the Hindi heartland by winning Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. However, the Congress came to power in Telangana, ending the nearly 10-year rule of the BRS.\n\nParliament Security Breach\n\nIn a shocking incident, two youths jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber from the public gallery during Zero Hour, released yellow gas from canisters and shouted slogans before being overpowered by the MPs on December 13. The incidents came on a day when the nation is observing the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament attack.",

    "articleBody": "This has been a year of seismic changes in India's science and technology ecosystem. The government set up a new body that will oversee research and development with a projected outlay of a whopping Rs 50,000 crores. The country also silently witnessed the first-ever high-profile dismissal of the sitting Secretary of the Department of Science and Technology (DST). The government also abolished many awards instituted by the science ministry without the approval of the Cabinet, causing a lot of heartburn among Indian scientists.\n\nThe shutting down of Vigyan Prasar, an autonomous unit of the Department of Science and Technology tasked with the popularization and outreach of S&T, came as disbelief. Especially since, for India to become a developed country by 2047, the foundation of this 'viksit bharat' has to be based on the use of atmanirbhar R&D. Explaining the complexities of science is a continuous exercise to dispel myths that come in the way of the organic diffusion of technologies. Sometimes omnibus decisions of the government take a collateral toll.\n\nOn the science front, India's space agency continued to bring back laurels by soft landing nearer the South Pole of the Moon. Likewise, after a long wait, the Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors at Kakrapar in Gujarat, capable of producing up to 700 Megawatts of nuclear power, became operational\u2014critical for India's Net Zero target. The year also saw the Covid-19 pandemic ebbing to a point that almost all curbs were removed. This came on the back of the country delivering over two billion doses of the vaccine against the Novel Coronavirus.\n\nIn a swift but expected move on August 9, 2023, in the monsoon session, the Parliament passed the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Bill, 2023. The Act will establish NRF, an apex body to provide high-level strategic direction for scientific research in the country as per the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP). The total estimated cost is Rs. 50,000 crores during five years (2023-28), a highly laudable aspirational development embedded with a lot of wishful thinking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking in the Parliament, Union Science Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh said, \"Anusandhan National Research Foundation\" will define the stature of India in 2047 as it will catapult us to the league of developed nations pioneering new research in new frontiers.\n\n\u201cThis is a Bill that is going to have a long-term effect, long-term outcomes, and all of us, each citizen of India, including those sitting on the other side, are going to be stakeholders. To that extent, this is possibly history in the making,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Singh added, \u201cIt envisages spending of Rs. 50,000 crores for five years, out of which Rs. 36,000 crores, almost 80%, is going to come from non-government sources\u2014from industry & philanthropists, from domestic as well as outside sources.\u201d Now, this is where the whole concept of A-NRF runs into a problem since the Indian industry has never invested this kind of money in R&D. The Indian industry prefers to buy ready-made foreign technology rather than persevering to develop its own intellectual property portfolio.\n\nAn assessment by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister lays the truth bare when it states that 'as a fraction of GDP, public expenditure on R&D has been stagnant over the past two decades. It has remained constant at around 0.6% to 0.7% of GDP. This is well below that in major countries such as the US (2.8), China (2.1), Israel (4.3), and Korea (4.2). Public expenditure is not only dominant but also the driving force of R&D spend in the country. This is in sharp contrast to the pattern in most advanced countries where the private sector is the dominant force.' Can the mere creation of the A-NRF reverse this trend?",

    "articleBody": "Awni Eldous: The Palestinian boy who found YouTube fame after death\n\nBy Alice Cuddy BBC News, Jerusalem\n\nFACEBOOK\n\nAwni Eldous was known for his love of computers and gaming\n\nAfter Awni Eldous died, his dreams came true.\n\nIn a video posted in August 2022, he holds a microphone and smiles as he declares his ambitions for his YouTube gaming channel.\n\n\"So now folks, let me introduce myself: I am a Palestinian from Gaza, aged 12 years old. The aim of this channel is to reach 100,000 subscribers, or 500,000, or one million,\" he says.\n\nHe ends the short video saying \"peace out\" to his 1,000 subscribers before walking out of view.\n\nJust over a year later, Awni became one of the first Palestinian children to be killed in the war.\n\nRelatives say Awni's family home was hit in an Israeli strike on 7 October, just hours after Hamas gunmen stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 240 hostage.\n\nWatch: Awni Eldous introducing his YouTube channel in 2022\n\nAwni's video now has millions of views - and other videos in which he voicelessly plays computer games have millions more. Nearly 1.5 million people have subscribed to his YouTube channel.\n\nTo his aunt, Ala'a, he was a happy, confident and helpful boy who would hold the door open for her. Another family member called him \"engineer Awni\" because of his love of computers.\n\nTo others, this 13-year-old gamer has become a kind of symbol, representing the loss of children in the Gaza Strip. \"Please forgive us,\" reads one comment on his video. \"I wish we knew you before you died.\"\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 20,000 people have been killed there since the war began - more than a third of them children. The UN children's agency (Unicef) has described it as the \"most dangerous place in the world to be a child\".\n\n'It was sudden, boom'\n\nThe day of the Hamas attack, as Israel began to retaliate, Ala'a imagined a bomb destroying her family's home in Gaza City. That night, around 20:20, her phone lit up with messages from friends: Awni's family home had been hit.\n\nA different branch of the family lived on each floor of the three-storey building in the Zeitoun neighbourhood. Awni lived on a floor with his mum and dad, his two older sisters, and two younger brothers.\n\nThe strike was also documented in October by human rights group Amnesty International.\n\nFAMILY HANDOUT\n\nAwni (right) with his sisters and brothers, who were all killed\n\n\"Two bombs fell suddenly on top of the building and destroyed it. My wife and I were lucky to survive because we were staying on the top floor,\" Awni's uncle Mohammed said.\n\nBoth he and a neighbour said they had received no warning. \"It was sudden, boom,\" the neighbour said.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not comment on this specific strike but said it was striking military targets and that Hamas had a \"documented practice of operating from nearby, underneath and within densely populated areas\".\n\nIt said: \"The IDF's strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including the taking of feasible precautions and after an assessment that the expected incidental damage to civilians and civilian property is not excessive in relation to the expected military advantage from the attack.\"\n\nIt added that the IDF \"regrets any harm caused to civilians or civilian property as a result of its operations, and examines all its operations in order to learn and improve and ensure all activity was in accordance with operational procedures and the law\".\n\n'He wanted followers and fans'\n\nAla'a didn't want to believe the messages she was receiving. But after connecting to the wi-fi, she saw that a close friend of the family had shared a photo of her brother on social media with the caption: \"Rest in peace.\" She ran to the hospital.\n\n\"They asked me to see the bodies but my husband refused\u2026 he wanted me to remember their beautiful faces when they were alive,\" she says in a Facebook message, sent from the south of Gaza, where she is now displaced.\n\nAla'a says 15 members of her family were killed that night, among them Awni.\n\nShe describes him as being a calm, helpful boy. His dad was a computer engineer and Ala'a says that for as long as she can remember, Awni would copy his father, pulling laptops apart and then trying to piece them back together.\n\nIn photos Awni shared on his own Facebook page, he stands in front of a blackboard holding up a computer motherboard to fellow students, as he leads a technology lesson organised as part of a \"little teachers\" scheme. Pictures published on his school's Facebook page show him winning numerous awards.\n\nShortly after his death, one of his teachers shared a photo with Awni, describing the boy's \"ever-lasting smile\".\n\nFACEBOOK\n\nAwni and his teacher\n\nOutside of school, Ala'a says Awni loved spending time with his family. On one \"very wonderful night\", Ala'a says she watched a film with Awni and his siblings, sharing crisps and chocolates.\n\nThe last time she saw him was at a family breakfast three weeks before his death, where she looked at her nephew and said: \"Awni is becoming a man.\"\n\nMostly, Awni loved computers and gaming, and he idolised the YouTubers who made careers out of his hobby.\n\n\"He wanted to be like them - to have followers and fans,\" Ala'a says.\n\nAwni started his channel in June 2020. His videos show him playing Pro Evolution Soccer, the car racing game Blur and the first-person shooting game Counter-Strike.\n\nLong captions give details of the games, the companies that made them and the dates of their release.\n\nIn a video of Awni with an uncle, the pair promise a \"special\" range of content on the channel, declaring in unison: \"It will be a blast.\"\n\nThey grin and gesticulate as they take it in turns to talk. They say they plan to expand the channel to include vlogs and interviews.\n\nYoutube\n\nAwni was an ambitious boy who asked lots of questions, family members say\n\nAshraf Eldous, a distant relative of Awni who works as a programmer and helps run several YouTube channels, says the teenager would frequently contact him asking for advice.\n\nIn messages from August 2022, shared with the BBC, Awni addresses \"brother Ashraf\" as he asks for YouTube tips. He would even take his father's phone in secret to ask for advice, Ashraf recalls.\n\nAshraf says the last time he spoke to Awni's father, he was told: \"Take care of Awni. Answer his questions. He's ambitious.\"\n\n\"His ambition was to be my competitor or colleague,\" Ashraf says. \"He created a YouTube channel. It wasn't that big, it didn't have any big views. Every start-up is hard at the beginning.\"\n\nBut after Awni's death in October, the views mounted when his fledgling channel caught the attention of established YouTubers, including Kuwaiti gamer AboFlah.\n\nIn an emotional video now viewed almost nine million times, AboFlah cries and walks away from the camera.\n\nHe has just discovered messages Awni had sent him on social media.\n\nOne of those message says: \"Nothing compares to Palestine's winter in Gaza; the atmosphere is legendary. We're drinking sahlab [a sweetened milk drink]. It's so good. We're also eating roasted chestnuts. I hope you come to Palestine. Much love.\"\n\nIn another, Awni writes to AboFlah: \"You're a legend and a role model.\"\n\nIn the video, as AboFlah weeps, he says: \"It's such a shame for this child to die\u2026 This child is one of many others who are even younger than him. If God wills it, they'll be birds of paradise.\"\n\n\"What you see is from the heart. I could not stop my tears,\" AboFlah tells the BBC, reflecting on the video he uploaded in October.\n\n\"It was very touching to hear that he looked up to me as a role model.\"\n\nAsked why he thinks Awni has made such a big impact, AboFlah says: \"Fans see themselves in Awni. We are all Awni.\"\n\nThe teenager's entire family - his four brothers and sisters and mother and father - were killed alongside him. But his surviving relatives say they are proud of the fame he has found after death.\n\n\"It's a gift from God that so many people around the world love Awni,\" says Ala'a.\n\n\"He used to talk about it enthusiastically, about his channel. He is more happy in heaven now.\"",

Meanwhile, the number of Israeli soldiers killed in combat over the weekend rose to 15. The 68 fatalities include at least 12 women and seven children, according to early hospital figures. \u201cWe were all targeted,\u201d said Ahmad Turokmani, who lost several family members including his daughter and grandson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza anyway.\u201d Earlier, the Health Ministry in Gaza gave the death toll as 70. The Israeli military had no immediate comment.\n\nBodies of 5 more hostages recovered: IDF\n\nBesides airstrikes, the IDF claimed it recovered the bodies of at least five Israeli hostages killed in captivity from an underground tunnel network of Hamas in northern Gaza.\n\n\"In a centralized intelligence effort, IDF troops located and recovered the bodies of 5 hostages abducted during the October 7 massacre and brought them back to Israel,\" the IDF posted on X.\n\nAs Christmas Eve fell, smoke rose over the besieged territory, while in the West Bank Bethlehem was hushed, its holiday celebrations called off. In neighbouring Egypt, tentative efforts continued on a deal for another exchange of hostages for Palestinians held by Israel.\n\nThe war has devastated parts of Gaza, killed roughly 20,400 Palestinians and displaced almost all of the territory's 2.3 million people.\n\nThe mounting death toll among Israeli troops - 154 since the ground offensive began - could erode public support for the war, which was sparked when Hamas-led militants stormed communities in southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 and taking 240 hostages.\n\nIsraelis still largely stand behind the country's stated goals of crushing Hamas' governing and military capabilities and releasing the remaining 129 captives. That's despite rising international pressure against Israel's offensive, the soaring death toll and unprecedented suffering among Palestinians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsraeli PM says he has no option left\n\n\u201cThe war exacts a very heavy price from us, but we have no choice but to continue fighting,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.\n\nIn a nationally televised speech, Israeli President Isaac Herzog appealed for the country to remain united.\n\n\u201cThis moment is a test. We will not break nor blink,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been widespread anger against his government, which many criticized for failing to protect civilians on October 7 and promoting policies that allowed Hamas to gain strength over the years.\n\nNetanyahu has avoided accepting responsibility for the military and policy failures.\n\n\u201cOver time, the public will find it hard to ignore the heavy price paid, as well as the suspicion that the aims that were loudly heralded are still far from being attained and that Hamas is showing no signs of capitulating in the near future,\" wrote Amos Harel, military affairs commentator for the Haaretz newspaper.\n\nHamas dismantling\n\nThe Israeli military said it had completed the dismantling of Hamas' underground headquarters in northern Gaza, part of an operation to take down the vast tunnel network and kill off top commanders that Israeli leaders have said could take months.\n\nEfforts toward negotiations continued. The head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, arrived in Egypt for talks. The militant group, which also took part in the October 7 attack, said it was prepared to consider releasing hostages only after fighting ends.\n\nHamas' top leader Ismail Haniyeh travelled to Cairo for talks days earlier.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nAlso Read: Israel airstrikes kill nearly 100 Palestinians, Biden calls Netanyahu but doesn't ask for ceasefire\n\nLatest World News",

Little did he know that his life would be tragically cut short just over a year later in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Awni\u2019s introductory video, where he thanked his 1,000 subscribers, has now garnered over four million views, making him a symbol of the countless children affected the violence in the Gaza Strip.\n\nMessages of sorrow and regret flood in from viewers who wish they had known Awni before his untimely death. To his family members, he was a joyous and talented boy, known for his love of computers and gaming. Awni\u2019s subscriber count has reached almost 1.5 million and continues to grow, showcasing his potential as a content creator.\n\nAwni and his family\u2019s home were hit in an Israeli strike, which took place on the same day that Hamas gunmen attacked Israel. The strike, documented Amnesty International, was sudden and unexpected, with no warning given. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that they were targeting military sites and that Hamas has a history of operating from densely populated areas.\n\nAwni\u2019s aunt, Ala\u2019a, deeply mourns the loss of her nephew. She describes him as a calm and helpful boy who aspired to be like the YouTubers he idolized. Awni started his channel in 2020 and shared videos of himself playing various games. He had plans to expand the channel to include vlogs and interviews.\n\nAwni\u2019s death reminds us of the devastating impact of conflict on innocent lives, especially on children. The war in Gaza has claimed the lives of over 20,000 people, with more than a third of them being children. It serves as a stark reminder that efforts for peace and protection of civilians should always be a top priority.\n\nAlthough Awni\u2019s life was tragically cut short, his passion for gaming and his dreams will continue to live on through his YouTube channel. He will forever be remembered as a promising Palestinian gamer, whose potential was never fully realized.",

It forecasts Brent to peak at $85 a barrel next June.\n\nThe bank\u2019s analysts said \u201cthe key reason\u201d for the revised price expectations was \u201congoing gains in drilling speed and well completion intensity\u201d in the United States.\n\nBrent and West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, were both up 3.5% to trade at $79 and $74 a barrel respectively by 9.58 am ET Monday.\n\nThe upswing came after oil giant BP said it would pause all shipments through the Red Sea because of increased attacks on vessels by Hamas-supporting Houth\ufeffi militants in Yemen.\n\nBoth oil contracts are still down from the 13-month highs of $95 and $94 respectively hit in September. Prices have fallen despite the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies \u2014 a group of the world\u2019s major oil producers known as OPEC+ \u2014 saying they will extend a supply cut of 2.2 million barrels per day through the first quarter of next year in an effort to buoy prices.\n\nRecord levels of oil production in the United States have helped drive those price declines. The US Energy Information Administration expects crude oil output to have reached an all-time high of 12.9 million barrels a day on average this year, and to hit another record average of 13.1 million barrels a day in 2024.\n\nMarkets are also fretting o\ufeffver a likely drop in demand for crude, especially in China, where there are persistent signs of a weakening economy.\n\nStill, Goldman Sachs said, the supply cuts by OPEC+, a potential economic rebound in China, as well as a \u201cmodest\u201d risk of a US recession, among other factors, are likely to limit the extent of falls in oil prices.\n\nCraig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote in a note Monday that optimism among investors that the world\u2019s major central banks might soon start cutting interest rates \u201chas boosted the odds of a softer landing, which could support demand (for oil).\u201d\n\nA \u201csoft landing\u201d describes a successful campaign by a central bank to lower inflation through interest rate hikes without tipping the economy into recession.",

    "articleBody": "In recent discussions I held with senior IDF commanders and the Air Force, I got a clear impression that the IDF can achieve a decisive outcome in the Strip and accomplish the war's goals. However, achieving this will come at heavy losses and will require a considerable amount of time to complete, at least several months.\n\n<< Follow Ynetnews on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | TikTok >>\n\nMore stories:\n\nThe question Israel is faced with is whether the public and political echelon will give the IDF the time and diplomatic backing it needs to do so. Security experts believe that, at the moment, this doesn\u2019t depend on the U.S. but on Israeli public opinion, resilience, and political support.\n\n4 View gallery IDF forces operating in the Gaza Strip ( Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit )\n\nHamas' final bastions\n\nIn a brief visit to Khan Younis last week, observing IDF forces in the northern part of the Strip clarified just how much time and effort such fighting takes. In the northern part of the Strip, the IDF has gained control over most of the territory including in underground facilities.\n\nIn the only remaining terror bastion in the northern part of the Strip, Daraj Tuffah, fierce battles are still taking place against terrorists and those who likely fled there from Jabaliya and Shijaiyah. In contrast, in the central part of the Strip, intense fighting is still ongoing and is expected to continue for a long time.\n\nWhile traveling to the southern part of the Strip, the urban landscape becomes more open, explaining why the IDF is facing more difficulties here than in densely populated areas. The destruction in the north is making it much harder for Hamas terrorists to come out from underground tunnels and fire at forces due to the wreckage.\n\nHowever, in the Khan Younis area and Hamas camps north of the city, tunnels are almost everywhere and make it easy for terrorists to operate from within them. The IDF was astonished to discover that Hamas's underground facilities are 500%-600% larger than previously estimated \u2013 turning the initial estimation of 500 km of unground tunnels and 1,000 shafts across the Strip into the understanding that the tunnels and shafts number in the thousands.\n\n4 View gallery IDF soldier in the Gaza Strip ( Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit )\n\nIt turns out that Hamas' politburo center was in the northern part of the Strip, but the crucial and main military center is located in the Khan Younis area. This center enables terrorists\u2014members of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad\u2014to move forces from place to place and strike IDF forces from both long and short ranges as they choose.\n\nAs long as the IDF was moving in the south and central areas of the Strip, terrorists didn\u2019t rush to combat them but focused on laying explosives to ambush the troops. Now, as the IDF moves less and shifts to eliminating infrastructure, the terrorists are moving in their anti-tank units to target the IDF.\n\nIDF troops and the Air Force can\u2019t fully employ their firepower in this area as they did in the northern part of the Strip due to the number of safety zones for the civilian population scattered in the Khan Younis area, with Hamas preventing them from escaping.\n\nMoreover, the IDF is still fighting to gain control in the central part of the Strip prior to dismantling terror infrastructure in the area. At this stage, progress is slow because the area is vast, and any hasty move incurs high costs.\n\nThe lack of progress in this area also stems from a desire not to harm Israeli hostages. It can be assumed that the majority of captives are currently held in the central part of the Strip, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has surrounded himself with an unknown number of captives, mainly soldiers, so that if the IDF reach him and his senior command, the captives will also be harmed \u2013 either by IDF forces or the terrorists.\n\n4 View gallery Hamas terror leader Yahya Sinwar ( Photo: EPA )\n\nThis is the exact reason why Sinwar and Hamas\u2019 top officials feel they have the upper hand and can dictate to Israel when the fighting needs to stop including a complete withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nAll of this is happening even though Sinwar likely knows that the IDF has succeeded in neutralizing the majority of Hamas\u2019 and the Islamic Jihad\u2019s fighting force. According to recent data, the IDF has managed to kill between 7,000 and 9,000 terrorists from both organizations, and injure around 20,000 of them. The implication is dramatic, but doesn\u2019t deter Sinwar, who still believes he could pressure the international community to stop the fighting while leveraging the Israeli captives for more time.\n\nAir Force crucial for fighting in Gaza\n\nThe Air Force is frustrated with this situation and discusses dilemmas that only the political leadership can address, the commanders also say they\u2019re certain these dilemmas will be solved and victory will be achieved.\n\nThe Air Force\u2019s operation in the current war is different than in any other war. The Air Force not only carries out air strikes that distance the civilian population and assist ground forces in entering the northern part of the Strip, but it now also operates in several other ways designed to provide backup while mitigating losses.\n\nThese new operations include striking Hamas tunnels in which senior figures are hiding, readying an area of the strip for the advancing soldiers while utilizing attack helicopters to scout and eliminate threats such as explosives or tunnel shafts, and providing air support for the soldiers fighting in the Strip in clashes against terrorists.\n\n4 View gallery Israeli Air Force fighter jet ( Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit )\n\nThese operations saved the lives of many soldiers who found themselves in tough situations during combat. However, there were also four cases in which the Air Force hit IDF soldiers. So far, less than five soldiers have been killed in such cases, but in general, the Air Force's involvement in the fighting expedites advancement in the Strip.\n\nIn Israel\u2019s northern border, the Air Force operates intensively to push Hezbollah away from the border fence, but it\u2019s clear that this can\u2019t be done solely from the air and will likely require a limited ground operation to distance Hezbollah not only beyond the current range of the anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), which is currently eight kilometers, but beyond it.",

    "articleBody": "Tel Aviv, December 24\n\nAt least 166 Palestinians and 14 Israeli soldiers were killed in combat in the Gaza Strip over the weekend, in some of the bloodiest days of battle since the start of the ground offensive and a sign that Hamas is still putting up a fight despite weeks of brutal war.\n\nThe mounting death toll among Israeli troops is likely to play an important factor in Israeli public support for the war, which was sparked when Hamas-led militants stormed communities in southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 and taking 240 hostage. The war has devastated parts of the Gaza Strip, killed roughly 20,400 Palestinians and displaced nearly 85 per cent of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people.\n\nThe Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza said 166 people were killed in the coastal enclave over the past day. Israelis still stand firmly behind the country\u2019s stated goals of crushing Hamas\u2019 governing and military capabilities and releasing the remaining 129 captives. That support has stayed mostly steady despite rising international pressure against Israel\u2019s offensive and the soaring toll and unprecedented suffering among Palestinians.\n\nBut the growing number of dead soldiers could undermine that support. Soldiers\u2019 deaths are a sensitive and emotional topic in Israel, a country with compulsory military service for most Jews.\n\nThe names of fallen soldiers are announced at the top of hourly newscasts, and in a small country of about 9 million people, virtually every family knows a relative, friend or co-worker who has lost a family member in war.\n\nThe 14 Israeli soldiers killed on Friday and Saturday died in battles in central and southern Gaza, an indication of how Hamas is still putting up tough resistance against advancing Israeli troops, even as Israel claims to have dealt a serious blow to the militant group. \u2014 AP\n\n\u2018No US pressure, israel a sovereign state\u2019\n\nIsraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed reports that the US had convinced Israel not to expand its military activity during a weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday. \u201cI have seen false publications... this is not true.

He talked about how the powerful seek to make a name for themselves in history, while \"the King of history chooses the way of littleness,\" which teed up his next point.\n\nAn emperor's census of the whole Earth, \"Manifests the all-too-human threat that runs through history: the quest for worldly power and might, fame and glory,\" Francis said.

    "articleBody": "The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, occupied West Bank, on December 24. Hazem Bader/AFP/Getty Images\n\nChurch bells echo through the labyrinth-like streets of Bethlehem. With Christmas approaching, the city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank should be teeming with visitors. But this year, it is almost deserted.\n\nLocal leaders made the decision last month to scale back festivities in solidarity with the Palestinian population\ufeff, as heavy fighting raged between Israel and Hamas in the devastated Gaza Strip.\n\nMore than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel\u2019s air and ground offensive, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza and nearly 85% of the strip\u2019s total population has been displaced.\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas\u2019 terror attack on October 7 on southern Israel in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage.\n\nMany here have ties to Gaza through loved ones and friends, and a sense of misery has fallen upon the city revered by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus Christ.\n\nDecorations that once adorned neighborhoods have been removed. The parades and religious celebrations have been canceled. In the city center, the traditional enormous Christmas tree of Manger Square is conspicuously absent.\n\nTraveling into Bethlehem, about 8 kilometers south of Jerusalem, isn\u2019t ordinarily an easy journey. The Israeli-built West Bank barrier restricts movement, as do the various checkpoints leading in and out of the city. It\u2019s only got worse since Hamas\u2019 brazen attack.\n\nSince October 7, Israel has restricted movement in Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the West Bank, with military checkpoints allowing access in and out, impacting Palestinians trying to get to work.\n\nThe occupied territory has also experienced a surge in violence, with at least 300 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\n\n\u201cMy son asked me why there\u2019s no Christmas tree this year, I don\u2019t know how to explain it,\u201d Ali Thabet tells CNN.\n\nHe and his family live in Al Shawawra, a Palestinian village near Bethlehem, and visit each Christmas \u201cbecause our relationship with our Christian brothers is a strong relationship.\u201d\n\nHe explains: \u201cWe join them in their celebrations, and they also join us in our celebrations. But this year\u2019s holiday season is very bad.\u201d\n\nRead more.",

    "articleBody": "At least 68 people were killed by an Israeli strike in central Gaza, health officials said Sunday, while the number of Israeli soldiers killed in combat over the weekend rose to 15. Associated Press journalists at a nearby hospital watched frantic Palestinians carry the dead, including a baby, and wounded following the strike on the Maghazi refugee camp east of Deir al-Balah. One bloodied young girl looked stunned while her body was checked for broken bones.The 68 fatalities include at least 12 women and seven children, according to early hospital figures.\n\n\u201cWe were all targeted,\u201d said Ahmad Turkomani, who lost several family members including his daughter and grandson. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza anyway.\u201dEarlier, the Health Ministry in Gaza gave the death toll as 70. The Israeli military had no immediate comment.As Christmas Eve fell, smoke rose over the besieged territory, while in the West Bank Bethlehem was hushed, its holiday celebrations called off. In neighboring Egypt, tentative efforts continued on a deal for another exchange of hostages for Palestinians held by Israel.\n\nThe war has devastated parts of Gaza, killed roughly 20,400 Palestinians and displaced almost all of the territory\u2019s 2.3 million people. The mounting death toll among Israeli troops \u2014 154 since the ground offensive began \u2014 could erode public support for the war, which was sparked when Hamas-led militants stormed communities in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 and taking 240 hostage.Israelis still largely stand behind the country\u2019s stated goals of crushing Hamas\u2019 governing and military capabilities and releasing the remaining 129 captives.\n\nThat\u2019s despite rising international pressure against Israel\u2019s offensive, and the soaring death toll and unprecedented suffering among Palestinians.HAMAS EXACTS A PRICE\u201cThe war exacts a very heavy price from us, but we have no choice but to continue fighting,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.In a nationally televised speech, Israeli President Isaac Herzog appealed for the country to remain united. \u201cThis moment is a test. We will not break nor blink,\u201d he said.There has been widespread anger against his government, which many criticize for failing to protect civilians on Oct. 7 and promoting policies that allowed Hamas to gain strength over the years.\n\nNetanyahu has avoided accepting responsibility for the military and policy failures.\u201cOver time, the public will find it hard to ignore the heavy price paid, as well as the suspicion that the aims that were loudly heralded are still far from being attained, and that Hamas is showing no signs of capitulating in the near future,\u201d wrote Amos Harel, military affairs commentator for the Haaretz newspaper.The Israeli military said it had completed the dismantling of Hamas\u2019 underground headquarters in northern Gaza, part of an operation to take down the vast tunnel network and kill off top commanders that Israeli leaders have said could take months.Efforts toward negotiations continued.\n\nThe head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, arrived in Egypt for talks. The militant group, which also took part in the Oct. 7 attack, said it was prepared to consider releasing hostages only after fighting ends. Hamas\u2019 top leader Ismail Haniyeh traveled to Cairo for talks days earlier.INSIDE GAZAIsrael\u2019s offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than two-thirds of the 20,000 Palestinians killed have been women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nOn Friday, Israeli airstrikes on two homes in Gaza killed 90 Palestinians, including dozens from an extended family, according to rescuers and hospital officials. One of the homes, located in Gaza City, became one of the deadliest airstrikes in the war after 76 people from the al-Mughrabi family were killed, said Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense department.The Palestinian Red Crescent said a 13-year-old boy was shot and killed in an Israeli drone attack while inside al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, a part of Gaza where Israel\u2019s military believes Hamas leaders are hiding.An Israeli strike overnight hit a house in a refugee camp west of the city of Rafah, on Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt.\n\nAt least two men were killed, according to Associated Press journalists in the hospital where the bodies were taken.At least two people were killed and six others wounded when a missile stuck a building in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.And Palestinians reported heavy Israeli bombardment and gunfire in Jabaliya, an area north of Gaza City that Israel had claimed to control.\n\nHamas\u2019 military arm said its fighters shelled Israeli troops in Jabaliya and Jabaliya refugee camp.Israel faces international criticism for the civilian death toll but it blames Hamas, citing the militants\u2019 use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel has launched thousands of airstrikes since Oct. 7. It says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, without presenting evidence.\n\nIsrael also faces allegations of mistreating Palestinian men and teenage boys detained in homes, shelters, hospitals and elsewhere during the offensive. It has denied abuse allegations and said those without links to militants are quickly released.Speaking to the AP from a hospital bed in Rafah after his release, Khamis al-Burdainy of Gaza City said Israeli forces detained him after tanks and bulldozers partly destroyed his home. He said men were handcuffed and blindfolded.\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep. We didn\u2019t get food and water,\u201d he said, crying and covering his face.Another released detainee, Mohammed Salem, from the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, said Israeli troops beat them.\n\n\u201cWe were humiliated,\u201d he said. \u201cA female soldier would come and beat an old man, aged 72 years old.\u201dINTERNATIONAL PRESSUREThe United Nations Security Council has passed a watered-down resolution calling for the speedy delivery of humanitarian aid for hungry and desperate Palestinians and the release of all the hostages, but not for a cease-fire.But it was not immediately clear how and when deliveries of food, medical supplies and other aid, far below the daily average of 500 before the war, would accelerate.\n\nTrucks enter through two crossings: Rafah, and Kerem Shalom on the border with Israel. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, said 123 aid trucks entered Gaza on Sunday,The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated U.N. calls for a humanitarian cease-fire, adding on social media that \u201cthe decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy.\u201dAmid concerns about a wider regional conflict, the U.S.\n\nCentral Command said a patrol ship in the Red Sea on Saturday shot down four drones launched from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, a while two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into international shipping lanes.The Iran-backed Houthis say their attacks are aimed at Israel-linked ships in an effort to stop the Israeli offensive in Gaza.",

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Israel Defense Forces struck at least three areas in central Gaza on Saturday and Sunday, including the Bureij and Maghazi refugee camps, as well as the city of Deir al-Balah, where on Friday it had urged residents to flee.\n\nLate on Sunday, the Gaza Health Ministry said 70 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a residential block in Maghazi. The Al Jazeera news network aired footage from what it said was the chaotic aftermath of the strike. In the dark, people scrambled to dig for survivors and directed the wounded, dazed and bloody, away from the site.\n\nA flood of patients arrived at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. \u201cYou can\u2019t even walk in the corridors\u201d of the hospital, Khalil al-Degran, a local doctor, told Al Jazeera. In the background, more than a dozen bodies covered in white shrouds were lined up on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe do not know where we will go,\u201d said Rami Abu Azara, 48, who sought refuge in Bureij, north of Maghazi, with his family after fleeing northern Gaza early in the war. \u201cAll the shelter centers in the central regions are crowded, and our fate will be on the street.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Israeli military called Abu Azara and his family over the weekend, he said, instructing them to leave Bureij and move toward Deir al-Balah. \u201cWe took refuge here thinking that these places were safe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the truth is that death stalks us from everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe IDF first urged residents on Friday to leave eight areas in central Gaza and evacuate south to shelters in Deir al-Balah, which the United Nations said \u201cis already overcrowded, hosting several hundred thousand IDPs,\u201d or displaced people, mostly from the north.\n\nBut the map accompanying the announcement was unclear, residents said, and appeared to include areas, such as neighborhoods in nearby Nuseirat, that weren\u2019t explicitly named in the statement. Adding to the confusion were the frequent communication outages across Gaza, leaving many Palestinians there without internet or cellphone connections to coordinate their evacuations.\n\nPeople in Gaza \u201care not pieces on a checkerboard,\u201d Thomas White, a senior U.N. official in Gaza, wrote Saturday on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cThe Israeli Army just orders people to move into areas where there are ongoing airstrikes. No place is safe, nowhere to go.\u201d\n\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society said earlier Sunday that its teams evacuated \u201ca large number\u201d of dead and wounded following a strike overnight on a house in Deir al-Balah. Also Sunday, the Gaza Health Ministry said 166 people had been killed over the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of recorded deaths in Gaza to 20,424 since the start of the war on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in a surprise attack inside Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe death toll released earlier Sunday did not include the 70 people later reported killed in the strike in Maghazi.\n\nIn a sign of the worsening fighting, 15 Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza over the weekend, the IDF said. The majority were killed in battles in southern Gaza, the military said, while four soldiers were killed in central Gaza on Saturday.\n\nThe IDF also continued to face fierce resistance in northern Gaza, where fighting raged north of Gaza City and in the Jabalya refugee camp. The military said that a tank commander was killed in northern Gaza on Sunday.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThis is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cThe war is exacting a very heavy cost from us; however, we have no choice (but) to continue to fight,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the increased strikes on central Gaza, Michael Milshtein, the former head of Palestinian affairs at Israel\u2019s military intelligence agency, said Sunday that he did not believe the IDF would immediately send ground troops into towns and cities in the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, he said, the military\u2019s current focus there is on destroying Hamas\u2019s tunnel network, as well as the group\u2019s ability to use the area to fire rockets.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Sunday that the IDF was \u201cdeepening the fighting,\u201d including in Khan Younis, where troops were also focused on uncovering and destroying \u201cunderground infrastructure.\u201d\n\nHe conceded that there were \u201cquite a few\u201d IDF casualties over the weekend, and downplayed earlier statements in which he said the military had \u201coperational control\u201d in parts of northern Gaza.\n\nThe war\u2019s escalation followed the passage on Friday of a painfully negotiated U.N. Security Council resolution on Gaza, which called for \u201curgent and extended\u201d pauses in the fighting. The measure, on which the United States abstained, also demanded the rapid expansion and facilitation of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where experts say the civilian population is now close to famine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a bleak report on Thursday, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global stakeholder initiative that helps measure and predict acute malnutrition, said that hostilities in Gaza have caused \u201ccatastrophic levels of acute food insecurity\u201d and that the risk of famine was \u201cincreasing each day.\u201d\n\nIt warned that Deir al-Balah and central Gaza were particularly vulnerable as the fighting expands. Wedged between Israeli troops in northern and southern Gaza, the war is \u201cpreventing significant portions of the population from accessing humanitarian assistance and basic services,\u201d including food, water, sanitation and health care.\n\n\u201cWe know that danger is approaching us and we know that the army has instructed all residents of Bureij camp to move, but where?\u201d said Anwar Islah, 31. He is sheltering with his family and thousands of others at a U.N.-run school in Bureij, but says they refuse to move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is true that we don\u2019t currently live in ideal conditions and we suffer from many diseases because of severe overcrowding,\u201d he said. \u201cBut displacement means that we will have chosen death many times.\u201d\n\nAlso in Bureij, at a separate school, Abu Azara says he is holding out hope that Israeli troops and tanks won\u2019t advance to where he and his family are staying. The displaced people in Bureij, he said, are worried they will face the same fate as evacuees from the north, who were forced to transit through Israeli checkpoints on a main road.\n\nThey are afraid \u201cthey will be arrested, stripped of their clothes,\u201d he said. But staying could also mean \u201ccertain death,\u201d Abu Azara added.\n\nBerger reported from Jerusalem and Harb from London.",

Photograph: ANI Photo\n\nA day after the attack on MV Chem Pluto that has 21 Indian crew members, the Navy said Sunday that a Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal specialist of the force will be embarking the vessel on arrival at Mumbai to sanitise it and undertake further investigation.\n\nThe Indian Navy continues to monitor the situation very closely with all stakeholders and remains committed to ensuring the safety of merchant shipping in the region, it said in a statement.\n\nThe Navy and the Indian Coast Guard swung into action on Saturday by swiftly deploying their assets, including a warship and maritime patrol aircraft, soon after the UK Maritime Trade Operations reported the drone \"attack\" on MV Chem Pluto.\n\nThe vessel, carrying crude oil to New Mangalore port from Al Jubail port in Saudi Arabia, was struck about 217 nautical miles from Porbandar on Saturday, an official said, adding there was no report of any casualties in the incident.\n\nThe Liberian-flagged vessel is now on its way to Mumbai and Indian Coast Guard ship ICGS Vikram is providing security to it, he said.\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson told Reuters news agency that MV Chem Pluto was hit by \"a one-way attack drone fired from Iran\".\n\n\"The motor vessel CHEM PLUTO, a Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned, and Netherlands-operated chemical tanker was struck at approximately 10 am local time (6 am GMT) today (Saturday) in the Indian Ocean, 200 nautical miles from the coast of India, by a one-way attack drone fired from Iran,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe merchant vessel is set to arrive in Mumbai on Monday, Indian officials said.\n\nSharing details of its response on Saturday, the Navy said its \"mission deployed\" platforms to respond swiftly to the \"maritime incident in the Arabian Sea involving a missile/ drone attack on MT Chem Pluto\".\n\n\"The vessel with 22 crew (21 Indians and one Vietnamese) was reported on fire after being hit by a projectile at around 0745 hours on December 23 likely to be a missile or drone,\" it said.\n\nResponding to the situation, the Indian Navy diverted a maritime patrol aircraft operating in the area undertaking routine surveillance.\n\nThe Navy also diverted the Indian naval ship Mormugao to assess the situation and provide assistance to vessel Chem Pluto, it said.\n\n\"The naval maritime patrol aircraft overflew MT Chem Pluto at 1315 hours on December 23 and established contact with the crew,\" it said in a statement.\n\nIt said the Navy also communicated details of the developing situation to all Indian maritime agencies for rendering necessary assistance.\n\nThe Navy said INS Mormugao established communication with the vessel at 1930 hours to ascertain if any assistance was required.\n\nThe Navy has launched an investigation into the incident including the origin of the strike, said an official on the condition of anonymity as the matter is sensitive in nature.\n\nThe incident came against the backdrop of Iran-backed Houthi rebels stepping up attacks on ships in the Red Sea amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nA Gabon-flagged commercial crude oil tanker with 25 Indian crew members also reportedly came under a drone attack in the Southern Red Sea but no one was injured, Indian officials and the US military said on Sunday.\n\nThe US Central Command said the vessel, MV Sai Baba, was targeted by a drone launched by Houthi militants in the Southern Red Sea on Saturday.\n\nIn the Arabian Sea incident, the Indian Coast Guard on Saturday night said MV Chem Pluto started making its way towards the Mumbai post undertaking damage assessment and repairs on its power generation systems.\n\n\"Indian Coast Guard Ship Vikram will be escorting the ship during its passage. The Indian Coast Guard Operations Centre is monitoring the situation closely,\" it said.\n\nOn Saturday, the UKMTO which operates under Britain's Royal Navy said it received a report of an attack by Uncrewed Aerial System on a vessel causing an explosion and fire, adding the incident took place 200 nautical miles South West of Veraval in India.\n\nIt said the fire was \"extinguished\" and there were no casualties.\n\nThe UKMTO is a British military organisation that provides maritime security information and largely acts as the primary point of contact for merchant vessels involved in maritime incidents.\n\nThe Coast Guard said its Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Mumbai received information regarding the fire onboard MV Chem Pluto.",

    "articleBody": "The United States, key allies and Arab nations engaged in high-level diplomacy in hopes of avoiding another US veto of a new UN resolution on desperately needed aid to Gaza ahead of a long-delayed vote now scheduled for Thursday morning.\n\nThe US has been struggling to change the text's references to a cessation of hostilities in the Israel-Hamas war. Another sticking point is the inspection of aid trucks into Gaza to ensure they are only carrying humanitarian goods. The current draft proposes a U.N. role, an idea Israel is likely to oppose.\n\nUS President Joe Biden told reporters on his way back from Milwaukee, Wisconsin late Wednesday afternoon that \"we're negotiating right now at the UN the contours of a resolution that we may be able to agree to.\"\n\nAmbassador Lana Nusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates, which sponsored the Arab-backed resolution, said earlier that high-level discussions are underway to try to reach agreement on a text that can be adopted.\n\n\"Everyone wants to see a resolution that has impact and that is implementable on the ground,\" she told reporters after the 15 council members held closed consultations early Wednesday afternoon and agreed to the delay. \"We believe today, giving a little bit of space for additional diplomacy, could yield positive results.\"\n\nThe vote initially postponed from Monday and then pushed back to Tuesday and then Wednesday is now expected on Thursday morning, said Ecuador's U.N. Ambassador Jos Javier De La Gasca L pez-Dom nguez, the current Security Council president.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomacy, said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken would speak with his Egyptian and UAE counterparts to try to reach a consensus either late Wednesday or early Thursday.\n\nAs part of the U.S. push at the U.N., Blinken spoke Wednesday with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom and stressed the need for urgent humanitarian aid to Gaza, \"the imperative of minimizing civilian casualties,\" and preventing further escalation of the conflict and \"underscored the U.S. commitment to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.\n\nNusseibeh said the UAE is optimistic, but if the negotiations yield no results by Thursday \"then we will assess in the council to proceed ... to a vote on the resolution.\"\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ant nio Guterres has said Gaza faces \"a humanitarian catastrophe\" and that a total collapse of the humanitarian support system would lead to \"a complete breakdown of public order and increased pressure for mass displacement into Egypt.\"\n\nThe U.N. food agency reported last week that 56% of Gaza's households are experiencing \"severe levels of hunger,\" up from 38% two weeks earlier.\n\nThe draft on the table Monday morning called for an \"urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities,\" but this language was watered down in a new version that was to be put to a vote on Wednesday. It would call \"for the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities.\"\n\nThat draft also calls for Guterres to quickly establish a mechanism for exclusive U.N. monitoring of aid deliveries to Gaza bypassing the current Israeli inspection of aid entering the strip.\n\nA council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions were private, said the U.S. and Egypt are engaging directly to ensure any aid monitoring mechanism can work for everyone.\n\nU.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also raised two other issues Wednesday morning that are not in the Arab-sponsored resolution condemnation of Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 incursion into southern Israel that sparked the latest war and Israel's right to self-defense.\n\nThe U.S. on Dec. 8 vetoed a Security Council resolution, backed by almost all other council members and dozens of other nations, demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza. The 193-member General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a similar resolution on Dec. 12 by a vote of 153-10, with 23 abstentions.\n\nIn its first unified action on Nov. 15, with the U.S. abstaining, the Security Council adopted a resolution calling for \"urgent and extended humanitarian pauses\" in the fighting, unhindered aid deliveries to civilians and the unconditional release of all hostages.\n\nSecurity Council resolutions are important because they are legally binding, but in practice many parties choose to ignore the council's requests for action. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they are a significant barometer of world opinion.\n\nNearly 20,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, since the war started. During the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took about 240 hostages back to Gaza.\n\nHamas controls the Gaza Strip, and its Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.

Advertisement\n\nIn a speech delivered at the US 5th Fleet headquarters, the US defense secretary added: \u201cThe attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea region constitute a global danger, and the joint forces led by the United States aim to enhance maritime navigation security and keep sea lanes open to the flow of global trade.\u201d A US Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Jason Dunham (DDG 109) and Egyptian Navy frigate ENS Alexandria (F911) conduct manoeuvring-operation exercises during a 60 nations International Maritime Exercise/Cutlass Express 2022 (IMX/CE-2022), in Red Sea, in this photo taken on February 7, 2022 (credit: US NAVAL FORCES CENTRAL COMMAND/US NAVY THEOPLIS STEWART LL/HANDOUT VIA REUTERS)\n\nImmediately after Austin's announcement, the leadership of the 5th Fleet held a small press conference with the media, during which American military officials confirmed that \u201cthe Operation Prosperity Guardian coalition is a defensive alliance to protect shipping and secure the flow of maritime navigation and not to carry out military strikes against the Houthis,\u201d according to Bahraini media outlets. Advertisement\n\nOver 50 countries affected by Houthi attacks\n\nA military source, who refused to reveal his name or identity, told The Media Line that \u201cmore than 50 countries were affected by Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsraeli ships were not the only ones that were subjected to attacks. Rather, there were international cargo ships carrying goods to countries around the world, including Arab countries. The Houthis claim that their attacks are directed against ships heading to Israel only, as a response to the ongoing war in Gaza, but that's not the truth,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe source further asserted that more countries are expected to join this international naval coalition in the coming days to repel Houthi attacks on ships. Advertisement\n\nAlthough US Defense Secretary Austin announced Bahrain\u2019s participation in Operation Prosperity Guardian, the GCC island did not issue any statement about its participation. The King of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, also did not mention his country's involvement in the alliance during his meeting with Austin, the official Bahrain News Agency reported.\n\n\u201cThe king expressed his pride about the historical relations between Bahrain and America and a close and lasting partnership whose foundations have been based for decades on trust, mutual respect, and joint coordination as partners and allies,\u201d said a statement by Bahrain News Agency.\n\nThe statement continued: \u201cDuring the meeting, views were exchanged on the latest regional and international developments \u2026 including the situation in the Gaza Strip, the importance of working to achieve a ceasefire, protecting civilians, releasing hostages and detainees, and ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid to the residents of the Strip in accordance with of international humanitarian law, and the necessity of finding a horizon for comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East region.\u201d\n\nDivision amongst Arab media outlets\n\nArab media outlets were divided between supporters and opponents of the Operation Prosperity Guardian alliance, as media channels loyal to Iran or the Muslim Brotherhood attacked it. They stated that Bahrain\u2019s participation as the only Arab country in the alliance is tantamount to a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the Palestinian cause.\n\nMubarak Al-Ati, a Saudi political analyst, told The Media Line, \u201cNow, the United States is suffering from what Saudi Arabia previously warned about; Riyadh warned Washington of the Houthi attacks and their danger, but the Biden Administration\u2019s response was to remove the Houthi group from the terrorist lists.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cSaudi Arabia, from my point of view, did not participate in the Operation Prosperity Guardian coalition for several reasons. The first of which was that it came at the time of the Israeli war on Gaza, which means the anger of the Arab street will transfer from Israel to Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Houthi attacks against ships are not new, but the United States did not move to form an international coalition in response to these attacks until after the Houthis attacked ships heading to Israel,\u201d he added.\n\nThe other main reason that Saudi Arabia chose not to join the alliance is its ongoing efforts to end the war in Yemen that began in 2015. According to Al-Ati, the Saudi-led peace negotiations are in their final stages. \u201cTherefore, any Saudi participation in an alliance against the Houthis will eliminate these negotiations and the peace that Riyadh seeks to achieve,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cWe must not forget that there was a Saudi-Iranian reconciliation under Chinese sponsorship that took place March 2023, and therefore, joining an alliance against the Iran-backed Houthis means the collapse of the opportunity for peace with Tehran,\u201d he added.\n\nAl-Ati concluded by saying, \u201cUnder all circumstances, this [Operation Prosperity Guardian] alliance will serve Saudi Arabia. It will protect oil tankers that go to Europe and America, and some of these tankers are Saudi or carry Saudi oil. Riyadh benefits from this alliance even without participating in it.\u201d\n\nAlaa Habib, a researcher in Iranian affairs, told The Media Line, \u201cThe Houthi group is living its last days. It seems that the United States, under Israeli pressure, is serious about destroying the Houthis who have destabilized the security and stability of the region.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI see that Abdul-Malik al-Houthi will be eliminated by an air strike, and Iran will abandon him or even report his whereabouts and give his coordinates.\u201d\n\nCriticizing Bahrain's involvement in the coalition, Saad Amer, an Egyptian journalist, told The Media Line, \u201cThis coalition is directed to protect Israel\u2019s interests only. Choosing Bahrain as the headquarters of this coalition and announcing it is to implicate the Gulf countries in America's war to repel Israel's enemies.\u201d\n\nAccording to Amer, \u201cThe Houthis will target Bahrain, and the GCC countries will not remain silent. Therefore, these countries will have the power to confront Al-Houthi, who obstructed Israel's interests and caused it great losses.\u201d\n\nAbdullah Al-Ghanim, a retired military veteran, told The Media Line that \u201cBahrain is participating in this coalition because it is the headquarters of the US 5th Fleet.\u201d\n\nHe continued to explain that \u201cBahrain suffered from Houthi terrorism, as it caused the death of many Bahraini soldiers participating in Operation Restoring Hope in Yemen. The last Houthi operation in Saudi Arabia was targeting a headquarters for the Bahraini forces, which led to the killing of 5 soldiers and the wounding of dozens in September 2023, despite the existence of a truce and negotiations in Yemen.\u201d\n\nAccording to Al-Ghanim, \u201cThere is Joint Task Force 153, which is with wide participation from various Arab countries, and this coalition is an extension of this military force, so the Arab countries are essentially present in this coalition, but in another form.\u201d\n\nThis Joint Task Force 153 was formed to combat piracy in the Bab al-Mandab Strait, said Al-Ghanim, which is the same area in which the Operation Prosperity Guardian coalition will operate.\n\nMohammed Al-Maliki, a Saudi journalist, told The Media Line, \u201cThe Houthis worked to target Israel with drones, and seized a ship in order to whitewash their crimes in Yemen. The Houthis know very well that their end is near, but they worked to target Israel to gain Arab and international sympathy.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, explained Al-Maliki, \u201cSeveral years ago, the Houthis were targeting the holy cities Mecca and Medina, and they targeted the border areas with Saudi Arabia on an almost daily basis, but the US was content with just condemning them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe GCC countries also previously called for stopping the smuggling of Iranian weapons to the Houthis in Yemen, but the international community stood silent in the face of this smuggling, which led to the doubling of the Houthi power for several years,\u201d added Al-Maliki.\n\n\u201cThe United Nations, the United States, and the international community gave the Houthis full control over the port of Hodeidah in Yemen, and it has now become the center of ship hijacking operations, and now all countries are paying the price for inaction in preventing the Houthis from obtaining military and logistical resources,\u201d concluded Al-Maliki.",

    "articleBody": "The Houthi assaults on vessels from around the world in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait on the southern end of the Red Sea have pushed up freight and insurance rates and oil prices while diverting marine traffic to a much longer and costlier route around Africa photo: reuters\n\nPatricia Cohen\n\nLondon\n\n\n\nThe attacks on crucial shipping traffic in the Red Sea straits by a determined band of militants in Yemen \u2014 a spillover from the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza \u2014 is injecting a new dose of instability into a wor-ld economy already struggling with mounting geopolitical tensions.\n\n\n\nThe risk of escalating conflict in West Asia is the latest in a string of unpredictable crises, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, that have landed like swipes of a bear claw on the global economy, smacking it off course and leaving scars.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, more volatility lies ahead in the form of a wave of national elections whose repercussions could be deep and long. More than two billion people in roughly 50 countries, including India, Indo-nesia, Mexico, South Africa, the United States and the 27 nations of the European Parliame-nt, will head to the polls. Altogether, participants in 2024\u2019s elections Olympiad account for 60 per cent of the world\u2019s economic output.\n\nIn robust democracies, elections are taking place as mistrust in government is rising, electorates are bitterly divided and there is a profound and abiding anxiety over economic prospects.\n\nEven in countries where elections are neither free nor fair, leaders are sensitive to the economy\u2019s health. President Vladimir V Putin\u2019s decision this fall to require exporters to convert foreign currency into rubles was probably done with an eye on propping up the ruble and tamping down prices in the run-up to Russia\u2019s presidential elections in March.\n\nThe winners will determine crucial policy decisions affecting factory subsidies, tax breaks, technology transfers, the development of artificial intelligence, regulatory controls, trade barriers, investments, debt relief and the energy transition.\n\nA rash of electoral victories that carry angry populists into power could push governments toward tighter control of trade,\n\nforeign investment and immigration. Such policies, said Diane Coyle, a professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge, could tip the global economy into \u201ca very different world than the one that we have been used to\u201d. In many places, scepticism about globalisation has been fuelled by stagnant incomes, declining standards of living and growing inequality. Nonetheless, Coyle said, \u201ca world of shrinking trade is a world of shrinking income\u201d.\n\nMany economists have compared recent economic events to those of the 1970s, but the decade that Coyle said came to mind was the 1930s, when political upheavals and fin-ancial imbalances \u201cplayed out into populism and declining trade and then extreme politics\u201d.\n\nThe biggest election next year is in India. Currently the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy, it is jockeying to compete with China as the world\u2019s manufacturing hub. Taiwan\u2019s pre-sidential election in January has the potential to ratchet up tensions between the US and China. In Mexico, the vote will affect the government\u2019s approach to energy and foreign investment. And a new president in Indonesia could shift policies on critical\n\nminerals like nickel.\n\nThe US presidential election, of course, will be the most significant by far for the world economy. The approaching contest is already affecting decision-making. Last week, Washington and Brussels agreed to suspend tariffs on European steel and aluminium and on American whisky and motorcycles until after the election. The deal enables President Biden to appear to take a tough stance on trade deals as he battles for votes. Former President Donald J Trump, the likely Republican candidate, has championed protectionist trade policies and proposed slapping a 10 per cent tariff on all goods coming into the US \u2014 a combative move that would inevitably lead other countries to retaliate.\n\nTrump, who has echoed authoritarian leaders, has also indicated that he would step back from America\u2019s partnership with Europe, withdraw support for Ukraine and pursue a more confrontational stance toward China. \u201cThe outcome of the elections could lead to far-reaching shifts in domestic and foreign policy issues, including on climate change, regulations and global alliances,\u201d the consulting firm EY-Parthenon concluded in a recent report.\n\nNext year\u2019s global economic outlook so far is mixed. On the positive side of the ledger, the rapid fall in inflation is nudging central bankers to reduce interest rates or at least halt their rise. Reduced borrowing costs are generally a spur to investment and home buying.\n\nAs the world continues to fracture into uneasy alliances and rival blocs, security concerns are likely to loom even larger in economic decisions than they have so far.\n\n\n\nChina, India and Turkey stepped up to buy Russian oil, gas and coal after Europe sharply reduced its purchases in the wake of Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, tensions between China and the US spurred Washington to respond to years of strong-handed industrial support from Beijing by providing enormous incentives for electric vehicles, semiconductors and other items deemed essential for national security.\n\nThe drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea by Iranian-backed Houthi militia are a further sign of increasing fragmentation.\n\nIn the last couple of months, there has been a rise in smaller players like Yemen, Hamas, Azerbaijan and Venezuela that are seeking to change the status quo, said Courtney Rickert McCaffrey, a geopolitical analyst at EY-Parthenon and an author of the recent report. \u201cEven if these conflicts are smaller, they can still affect global supply chains in unexpected ways,\u201d she said. \u201cGeopolitical power is becoming more dispersed,\u201d and that increases volatility.\n\nThe Houthi assaults on vessels from around the world in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait on the southern end of the Red Sea have pushed up freight and insurance rates and oil prices while diverting marine traffic to a much longer and costlier route around Africa. Last week, the US said it would expand a military coalition to ensure the safety of ships passing through this commercial pathway, through which 12 per cent of global trade passes. It is the biggest rerouting of worldwide trade since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nClaus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the impact of the attacks had so far been limited. \u201cFrom an economic perspective, we\u2019re not seeing huge increase in oil and gas prices,\u201d Vistesen said, although he acknowledged that the Red Sea assaults were the \u201cmost obvious near-term flashpoint.\u201d\n\nUncertainty does have a dampening effect on the economy, though. Businesses tend to adopt a wait-and-see attitude when it comes to investment, expansions and hiring.\n\n\u201cContinuing volatility in geopolitical and geoeconomic relations between major economies is the biggest concern for chief risk officers in both the public and private sectors,\u201d a mid-year survey by the World Economic Forum found.\n\nWith persistent military conflicts, increasing bouts of extreme weather and a slew of major elections ahead, it\u2019s likely that 2024 will bring more of the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92023 The New York Times News Service",

As I said to the ICC, the armband was for a personal bereavement,\" he told reporters in Melbourne.\n\n\"The armband was different to my shoes. The shoes were very obvious. At the end of the day I didn't wear the shoes. I respected the rules and procedures and left it at that.\"\n\nHe added that being reprimanded for the armband \"makes no sense\" and pointed to other players who had previously put stickers on their bats and names on their shoes without approval and escaped punishment, urging the ICC to be more consistent.\n\n\"I will just be asking and contesting that they (ICC) make it fair for everyone and they have consistency in how they officiate. That's all I ask for, and from my point of view, that consistency hasn't been done yet,\" he said.",

    "articleBody": "In a report sent to Rigzone earlier this month, which focused on \u201coil and gas key themes for 2024\u201d, analysts at BMI, a Fitch Solutions company, said energy prices are expected to remain elevated due to geopolitical risks and strengthening OPEC+ resolve.\n\n\u201cUpside will be limited by an increasingly bearish outlook for developed markets that will weigh on fuel demand in the near-term,\u201d the analysts noted in the report.\n\n'Upside will be limited'. Image by GettyTim82 via iStock\n\n\u201cThe outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and the associated geopolitical risk premia is set to ensure that oil prices remain volatile in the near-term,\u201d they added.\n\n\u201cThis volatility will be further compounded by the ambiguity surrounding near-term OPEC+ quotas, as the group strives to maintain price support amid a weakening macroeconomic backdrop,\u201d they continued.\n\nThe BMI analysts stated in the report that there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the extent and timing of the unwinding of Saudi Arabia\u2019s unilateral one million barrel per day cut.\n\n\u201cFundamentals will be supported by the weakening of non-OPEC supply in 2024 as the U.S. shale sector shows increasing signs of weakness,\u201d the analysts said in the report.\n\n\u201cEmerging markets excluding Mainland China are set to drive oil demand growth in the near-term, helping to offset weakness in developed market\u2019s arising from an increasingly bearish macro environment in which our Country Risk team expect the U.S. to enter a mild technical recession by the middle of 2024,\u201d they added.\n\n\u201cThis will see annual oil price averages in 2024 remain near similar levels to 2023,\u201d the analysts went on to state.\n\nThe BMI analysts also noted in the report that an increasing shift towards LNG imports in Europe will keep gas prices above historical averages.\n\n\u201cEuropean gas markets have now largely become accustomed to the loss of Russian gas supply, with the continent turning heavily to imports of LNG to plug the deficit,\u201d the analysts said in the report.\n\n\u201cThis is a trend that is set to continue in 2024, with the further buildout of strong LNG import capacity in countries such as Germany, France and Italy which will continue to bolster the continent\u2019s gas supply security,\u201d they added.\n\n\u201cWhilst these developments will help to ensure that European gas prices remain far below the astronomical highs seen over the last two years, it will also mean that prices remain elevated above historical averages given the price premium associated with LNG relative to previous Russian pipelined imports,\u201d they continued.\n\nBrent Price Projections\n\nIn a separate report published on December 1, which was sent to Rigzone, BMI projected that the Brent price will average $84 per barrel in 2023, $85 per barrel in 2024, $84 per barrel in 2025, and $81 per barrel in both 2026 and 2027.\n\nA Bloomberg consensus included in that report forecast that Brent will average $84 per barrel this year, $85 per barrel next year, $83 per barrel in 2025, $79 per barrel in 2026, and $77 per barrel in 2027. BMI is a contributor to the Bloomberg consensus, BMI highlighted in the report.\n\n\u201cThis month we have left our Brent crude oil price forecast unchanged, at an annual average of $85 per barrel in 2024 and $84 per barrel in 2025,\u201d BMI noted in the report.\n\n\u201cIn our view, next year will be a tale of two halves: in H1, a sharp slowdown in developed market economies will put prices under heavy pressure; in H2, as global economic growth passes its nadir, sentiment will strengthen positioning Brent for healthy gains,\u201d it added.\n\nIn that report, BMI said oil prices \u201chave fallen precipitously over recent weeks, with Brent losing more than 10 percent of its value from its October highs\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe strength seen in prices last month stemmed from the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. While neither Israel nor Gaza produce oil in any significant volumes, there was a risk that, if the conflict were to spread, it would ultimately jeopardize Iranian exports or cargoes transiting the Strait of Hormuz,\u201d BMI added.\n\n\u201cTo date, the war has remained relatively well-contained and oil market participants seem to be rapidly discounting the probability of a further escalation,\u201d BMI continued.\n\nHowever, BMI added in the report that, \u201cas long as fighting continues, the risk of a miscalculation by either side remains acute, posing lingering upside risk to Brent\u201d.\n\nIn its latest short term energy outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast that the Brent spot price will average $82.40 per barrel this year and $82.57 per barrel next year.\n\nA Macquarie report sent to Rigzone last week showed that the company forecasts that Brent will average $82.21 per barrel in 2023 and $77 per barrel in 2024.\n\nIn another report sent to Rigzone earlier this month, Standard Chartered projected that the ICE Brent price will average $98 per barrel in 2024.\n\nTo contact the author, email andreas.exarheas@rigzone.com",

    "articleBody": "Bethlehem is normally at its busiest at Christmas, but this year war has scared away tourists and pilgrims from the Palestinian town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, leaving hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops deserted.\n\nWith global headlines dominated since October 7 by news of the Hamas attacks in southern Israel, followed by Israel's military assault on Gaza and a rise in violence in the West Bank, business owners in Bethlehem said no one is coming.\n\n\"We have no guests. Not one,\" said Joey Canavati, owner of the Alexander Hotel, whose family has lived and worked in Bethlehem for four generations.\n\n\"This is the worst Christmas ever. Bethlehem is shut down for Christmas. No Christmas tree, no joy, no Christmas spirit,\" he said.\n\nLocated just south of Jerusalem, Bethlehem is heavily reliant for income and jobs on visitors from all over the world who come to see the Church of the Nativity, believed by Christians to stand on the site where Jesus was born.\n\nCanavati said that before October 7, his hotel was fully booked for Christmas, to the point that he was looking for rooms elsewhere in the town to help out people he could not fit in.\n\nSince the war started, everyone cancelled, including bookings for next year. \"All we get on the email is cancellation after cancellation after cancellation,\" said Canavati.\n\nHe took Reuters TV on a tour of the hotel, opening doors to empty rooms and showing the silent dining room.\n\n\"We had at least 120 people having dinner here every night, and it was packed. The noise, the people. Empty. No Christmas breakfast, no Christmas dinner, no Christmas buffet,\" he said.\n\nSurge in attacks\n\nSince the 1967 war between Israel and neighbouring Arab countries, Israel has occupied the West Bank, which Palestinians want as the core of a future independent state.\n\nIsrael has built Jewish settlements, deemed illegal by most countries, across the territory. Israel disputes this, citing historical and biblical ties to the land. Several of its ministers live in settlements and favour their expansion.\n\nSince October 7, the West Bank has experienced a rise in attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinians, which were already at a 15-year high this year before the Hamas attack.\n\nBethlehem's Manger Square, a large paved space in front of the Church of the Nativity that usually serves as a focal point for Christmas celebrations, was quiet and almost empty, as were nearby streets where most souvenir shops were shuttered.\n\nRony Tabash, who sells crucifixes, statuettes of the Virgin Mary and other religious trinkets in his family's store, was tidying shelves and merchandise to pass the time.\n\n\"We are almost two months without any pilgrims, any tourists,\" he said, adding that he was keeping the store open as a way to stave off hopelessness.\n\n\"We want to feel that everything will be back, like to normal life,\" he said.\n\nAla'a Salameh, owner of falafel restaurant Afteem, said his business was operating at 10% or 15% of capacity, catering for local Palestinian families rather than the usual influx of foreign visitors.\n\nHe said he was keeping the restaurant open because his staff needed the work.\n\n\"I have workers, so from where I can give them money to take and to feed their families, their kids?\" he said.\n\n\"We are praying for peace. For peace. You know, Bethlehem is the city where peace was born, so it should be the messenger for peace to be spread all over the world,\" he added.\n\nPublished By: Ashutosh Acharya Published On: Dec 25, 2023\n\nALSO READ | Israel finds 5 hostages' bodies in Hamas tunnel, 78 dead in Gaza strikes Must Watch",

    "articleBody": "Pope Francis has kicked off global Christmas celebrations with a call for peace, as Israel's war on Hamas and Russia's invasion of Ukraine cast a shadow over one of the world's favourite holidays.\n\nHaving said earlier in the day that he was thinking of people \"who are suffering from war -- we are thinking of Palestine, of Israel, of Ukraine\", the pope struck a sombre tone during his Christmas Eve mass.\n\n\"Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,\" the pope said.\n\nThe biblical city in the occupied West Bank, where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born in a stable more than 2,000 years ago, effectively cancelled the annual Christmas celebrations that normally draw thousands of tourists.\n\nThe town did away with its giant Christmas tree, marching bands and flamboyant nativity scene this year, settling for just a few festive lights.\n\nIn the centre of town, a huge Palestinian flag had been unfolded with a banner declaring that \"The bells of Bethlehem ring for a ceasefire in Gaza\".\n\n\"A lot of people are dying for this land,\" said Nicole Najjar, an 18-year-old student.\n\n\"It's really hard to celebrate while our people are dying.\"\n\nThe Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said: \"We are here to pray and to ask not only for a ceasefire, a ceasefire is not enough, we have to stop these hostilities and to turn the page because violence generates only violence\".\n\nSister Nabila Salah from the Catholic Holy Church in Gaza -- where two Christian women were killed by an Israeli sniper earlier this month, according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem -- told AFP \"all Christmas celebrations have been cancelled\".\n\n\"How do we celebrate when we are... hearing the sound of tanks and bombardment instead of the ringing of bells?\" she said.\n\nIn Syria, churches limited celebrations to prayers in solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 left around 1,140 people dead in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest official Israeli figures.\n\nThe Palestinian militants also abducted around 250 people, 129 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.\n\nIsrael retaliated with a sustained bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, where 20,424 people have been killed, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\n- New Christmas Day -\n\nUkraine, invaded by Russia nearly two years ago, is celebrating Christmas on December 25 for the first time, jettisoning the traditional Orthodox date of January 7, which is feted in Russia, as a snub to Moscow.\n\nIn the southern Black Sea port of Odesa, churchgoers prayed and lit candles as priests in gold vestments held a Christmas Eve service in the Cathedral of the Nativity, decorated with fir trees and a nativity scene.\n\n\"We believe that we really should celebrate Christmas with the whole world, far away, far away from Moscow. For me that's the new message now,\" said one smiling parishioner, Olena, whose son is a medic on the front line.\n\nThe date change -- moving away from the Julian calendar favoured by the Orthodox Church -- is part of moves since the invasion to remove traces of the Russian and Soviet empires.\n\n- Surfing Santas -\n\nIn countries not afflicted by war, festive revellers donned Santa hats for a shot of holiday cheer -- running a city race in Skopje, North Macedonia; surfing the waves in Florida; jogging along muddy wooded paths on the outskirts of Paris; dipping in the sea near the British port of Dover; or soaking with a drink in hand in Lake Geneva.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, where the big day had already arrived, many residents and tourists headed to the beach, wearing the woolly red hats despite the heat in the Southern Hemisphere's summer.\n\nAnd children around the globe followed Santa, his reindeer and their present-laden sleigh with the help of Norad Tracks Santa, a 3-D interactive website run annually by a joint US-Canadian military monitoring agency.\n\n- Prayers in Turkey -\n\nIn southern Turkey, much of which was devastated by an earthquake in February, some faithful celebrated mass in front of the ruins of their church at Antakya.\n\n\"It's important for us to celebrate the birth of Jesus. but it's a very sad Christmas,\" said Vehbi Tadrasgil, a 55-year-old who lost his wife and two of his three children in the quake that killed at least 50,000 people in Turkey and more than 5,000 in neighbouring Syria.\n\n\"I hope that their souls are here, I am certain that our prayers rise to them,\" he said.\n\nTwenty kilometres (12 miles) down the coast in Samandag, a generator powered the lights on a tree in front of the Saint-Ilyas church, which survived.\n\n\"After the earthquake, our community -- 400 families -- was annihilated. With this Christmas, we want to wish everyone rebirth, love, joy and peace. We must move forward, rebuild a new life,\" said Father Yumurta.\n\n\"They say that with the birth of the child Jesus, a new life begins, a new beginning. For us too, here, it will be a new beginning,\" he said.",

    "articleBody": "Global Elections and Conflicts Set to Influence Economic Volatility\n\nThe global economic and political arena stands on the precipice of heightened volatility as we move into the next year. Fueling this are ongoing military conflicts, economic uncertainties, and a surge of national elections on the horizon. The aftermath of the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza casts a long shadow of instability, exacerbated by militant attacks on Red Sea shipping routes emanating from Yemen. Coupled with the persistent COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war, these events are carving deep grooves of disruption in the global economy, sparking concerns about future growth.\n\nGlobal Elections and Economic Outcomes\n\nOver two billion people in approximately 50 countries \u2013 spanning key economies like India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, the United States, and the European Union \u2013 are gearing up for elections that promise to mold economic policies and international relations for years to come. The rising distrust in governments, the emergence of populist candidates, and potential shifts towards protectionist policies pose a considerable threat to the global economic structure.\n\nAs these elections loom, leaders are making strategic decisions to strengthen their economies and political footholds. A case in point is Russia\u2019s President Putin, who has been influencing currency regulations in anticipation of the country\u2019s presidential elections. The outcomes of these elections are poised to dictate policies on trade, foreign investment, immigration, and more, potentially giving birth to a global economy starkly different from the one we know today.\n\nHistorical Parallels and Future Projections\n\nSkepticism about globalization, spurred by stagnant incomes and growing inequality, adds another layer of complexity to the situation. Economists are drawing parallels to past economic crises, suggesting that the current climate bears striking resemblance to the precursors to the 1930s\u2019 economic and political turmoil.\n\nForefront in shaping the global economic trajectory are the elections in India, Taiwan, Mexico, Indonesia, and the United States. The policy decisions in these countries will influence trade, manufacturing, foreign investment, and the critical sectors of energy and minerals. The U.S. presidential election, in particular, is expected to wield a profound impact, with potential shifts in climate change regulations, trade policies, and international alliances.\n\nGlobal Economy: A Mixed Bag of Positives and Negatives\n\nWhile the global economic outlook remains shrouded in uncertainty, with slow growth and potential sovereign debt crises, there are beams of positivity cutting through the gloom. Falling inflation rates and the possibility of reduced interest rates could stimulate investment and spending. Despite these silver linings, the geopolitical landscape is expected to become more fragmented and volatile, affecting global supply chains and economic stability.\n\nBNN Correspondents Founded by visionary entrepreneur Gurbaksh Chahal, BNN Newsroom has risen to prominence as a powerhouse in the international journalism landscape.

He does not save us by pushing a button, but draws near us, in order to change our world from within.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the traditional Angelus blessing overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square at midday, the pontiff remembered those suffering from war, recalling specific fighting in Ukraine and Israel\u2019s bombardment and siege of the Gaza Strip in response to Hamas\u2019 attack. \u201cWe are close to our brothers and sisters suffering from war. We think of Palestine, Israel, and Ukraine. We also think of those who suffer from misery, hunger, slavery,\u2019\u2019 Francis said. \u201cMay the God who took a human heart for himself infuse humanity into the hearts of men,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking from the window of his studio to the thousands of faithful gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square for the Angelus prayer, the pontiff also invited the faithful \u201cnot to confuse celebration with consumerism. One can and, as a Christian, must celebrate in simplicity without waste and by sharing with those who lack necessities or lack companionship.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy Christmas is celebrated\n\nTraditionally, Catholics mark Christmas Eve by attending Mass at midnight. But over the years, the starting time at the Vatican has crept earlier, reflecting the health or stamina of popes and then the pandemic. The Vatican has kept a 7:30 p.m. time originally set during a pandemic curfew.\n\nOn Christmas Day, tens of thousands of Romans, tourists and pilgrims were expected to crowd into St. Peter\u2019s Square to hear Pope Francis deliver an address on world issues and give his blessing. The speech, known in Latin as \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d (to the city and to the world), is traditionally an occasion to review crises including war, persecution and hunger, in many parts of the globe.\n\n(With inputs from the agency)\n\nAlso Read: Christmas 2023: Why is Christmas celebrated on December 25?

U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Aaron Lau/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Denmark's Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) is preparing to resume shipping operations in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the company said on Sunday, citing the deployment of a U.S.-led military operation designed to ensure the safety of commerce in the area.\n\nThe shipping giant paused sending vessels through the Bab el-Mandeb strait earlier in December due to attacks against its ships. That rendered the Suez Canal, which is key to global commerce, unusable for most routes.\n\nThe United States said on Tuesday it was launching a multinational operation to protect commerce in the Red Sea from Iran-backed Yemeni militants, who have been firing drones and missiles at international vessels since last month in what they say is a response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"As of Sunday 24 December 2023, we have received confirmation that the previously announced multi-national security initiative Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG) has now been set up and deployed to allow maritime commerce to pass through the Red Sea / Gulf of Aden and once again return to using the Suez Canal as a gateway between Asia and Europe,\" Masersk said in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\"With the OPG initiative in operation, we are preparing to allow for vessels to resume transit through the Red Sea both eastbound and westbound.\"\n\nMaersk said it would release more details in coming days. But it said it could again resort to diverting ship traffic depending on how safety conditions evolved.\n\nOn Tuesday, Maersk said it was rerouting ships around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope. It said it would impose container surcharges for shipments from Asia to cover the extra costs associated with the longer journey.\n\nSeveral other firms have stopped transiting the Red Sea on safety concerns in recent weeks, as has oil major BP (BP.L).\n\nReporting by Gram Slattery; Additional reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by David Ljunggren and Leslie Adler\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The development comes after a week-long ceasefire ended this month and negotiations on a new truce have been taking place in Cairo, Egypt.\n\n\"There is a Palestinian national decision that there should be no talk about prisoners or exchange deals except after a full cessation of aggression,\" BBC quoted a Hamas statement as saying.\n\nHamas has said that it had two pre-conditions for any serious negotiation. A Hamas official told news agency AFP, \"A total ceasefire and a retreat of the Israeli occupation army from the Gaza Strip are a precondition for any serious negotiation.\"\n\nIsrael has made its stance clear that it would not stop until the goal of Hamas' destruction is achieved. Israel has repeatedly rejected any proposition of a retreat from Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Thursday, \"We are fighting until victory. We will not stop the war until we achieve all its goals \u2014 completing the destruction of Hamas, and releasing all of our hostages,\" reported The Times of Israel.\n\nNetanyahu added that Hamas had a very simple choice -- surrender or die. He emphasised that Hamas does not have and will not have any other option. Israel has claimed that it killed more than 2,000 Hamas fighters in Gaza since the truce that was announced earlier this month during which more than 100 hostages were set free. However, around 120 people abducted from Israel on October 7 are still believed to be in Gaza's captivity, as reported by the BBC. This week-long truce brought an increased flow of aid into Gaza. The UN had earlier warned that the population was at risk of famine if the war between Israel and Hamas continues.",

Three years later, it was adapted into a dramatic film directed by Steven Spielberg. This new version is an adaptation of a 2005 stage musical, which itself was reworked for a successful 2015 revival.\n\nBut even as the reputation of \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d has soared over the decades, Walker\u2019s own has become more muddled \u2014 specifically for her difficult relationship to Judaism and her outright flirtations with antisemitism. Married to a prominent Jewish civil rights lawyer when she was younger, Walker in the mid-2010s began promoting works by an antisemitic conspiracy theorist and authored an antisemitic poem of her own.\n\nThis combined with her longtime outspoken criticism of Israel has led some in the Jewish community to question her continued stature as a well-regarded figure of American letters and led to her being disinvited from a major book festival just last year. Advertisement\n\nDespite the fact that Walker\u2019s reputation among Jews has nosedived since their first film together in 1985, Spielberg remains involved in the new \u201cColor Purple\u201d as a producer and walked the red carpet at the premiere with fellow producers Oprah Winfrey and Quincy Jones (who both worked on the first film as well). Directing duties this time went to Ghanaian filmmaker Blitz Bazawule. Alice Walker (credit: REUTERS)\n\nAmblin Entertainment, Spielberg\u2019s production company, did not return a request for comment for this story. Advertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Alice Walker right now.\n\nEarly life and love\n\nGrowing up in a sharecropper\u2019s shack in rural Georgia, Walker married into Judaism when she met Melvyn Leventhal, a young law student and civil rights activist with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, at a soul food restaurant in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1966. Walker, whose activism was influenced by her progressive Spelman College Jewish professor Howard Zinn, had returned to the South to join the civil rights movement after transferring to Sarah Lawrence and traveling through Europe.\n\n\u201cI glared across the room at the white people eating in \u2018our\u2019 restaurant and locked eyes with a very cute guy. Oy vey,\u201d Walker wrote in her journals at the time, later published in 2022. The two continued their courtship in New York until Leventhal finished law school. Advertisement\n\nThey were married in 1967 after Walker proposed to Leventhal and moved back to Mississippi, a state where interracial marriage was still illegal, to continue their activism. \u201cCan there be any doubt that, no matter what, we will live happily ever after?\u201d Walker wrote at the time. But Melvyn\u2019s mother Miriam deeply disapproved of the marriage, calling Walker a \u201cschvartze,\u201d using a derogatory Yiddish term for a Black person, and going so far as to sit shiva for her son. His brother, Walker later claimed, nailed a giant Confederate flag \u201cover an entire side of his bedroom\u201d in protest of the union.\n\nThe two had a daughter, Rebecca, together, who would later become a prominent feminist scholar and is an executive producer of the new \u201cColor Purple\u201d movie alongside her mother. Rebecca Walker\u2019s own autobiography, \u201cBlack, White, & Jewish,\u201d describes her feeling of being pulled between the identities of her parents; it was recently pulled from a Florida school district (along with \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d) with district officials citing sexual content.\n\nIn her journals, Walker called Leventhal \u201ca real Jew\u201d (emphasis hers), elaborating, \u201cHe loves justice, like one loves a magnificent misused person.\u201d But their marriage became strained, and the two divorced in 1976, having already been separated for years.\n\nA hard tack against Israel\n\nWalker\u2019s activism around Israel for years was contentious but largely in line with most pro-Palestinian thought.\n\nIn 2010, she published a short essay book, \u201cOvercoming Speechlessness: A Poet Encounters the Horror in Rwanda, Eastern Congo, and Palestine/Israel,\u201d that originated as an essay in the left-wing Jewish website Tikkun. In the book, she discusses visiting the Gaza Strip with the antiwar nonprofit CODEPINK in 2009, in the midst of an Israeli bombing campaign, and accuses world leaders of showing \u201cindifference to the value of Palestinian life that has corrupted our children\u2019s sense of right and wrong for generations.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost Jews who know their own history see how relentlessly the Israeli government is attempting to turn Palestinians into the \u2018new Jews,\u2019 patterned on Jews of the Holocaust era, as if someone must hold that place in order for Jews to avoid it,\u201d she writes, adding that she could never \u201crationally discuss\u201d Israel with her ex-husband. \u201cHe does not see the racist treatment of Palestinians as the same racist treatment of blacks and some Jews that he fought against so nobly in Mississippi, and that he objected to in his own Brooklyn-based family.\u201d She also listed several progressive Jews whom she said were friends of hers also protesting Israel, including Zinn, Muriel Rukeyser, Amy Goodman, and Noam Chomsky.\n\nIn 2012, Walker made her positions explicit when she turned down an offer to publish a new Israeli edition of \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d In a letter, she told publisher Yediot Books that she did this because she believed Israel \u201cis guilty of apartheid and persecution of the Palestinian people,\u201d and endorsed the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement \u2014 a tactic that bestselling Irish author and fellow BDS backer Sally Rooney would echo in 2021. (An earlier Hebrew-language edition of \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d was published in the 1980s.)\n\nIn 2013, the University of Michigan\u2019s Center for the Education of Women rescinded an invitation for Walker to speak at its 50th anniversary celebration; Walker would later claim that this was due to her views on Israel. But the university never gave a clear reason, and in fact invited her to speak again the following year without incident.\n\nFull-on Icke\n\nBy 2017, Walker\u2019s tone had hardened \u2014 not only against Israel, but also Jews more broadly. That year on her website, she published a poem entitled, \u201cIt Is Our (Frightful) Duty To Study The Talmud,\u201d in which Walker writes, \u201cAre Goyim (us) meant to be slaves of Jews, and not only / That, but to enjoy it?\u201d\n\nThe poem, a harsh critique of Israel and what Walker suggests is a Jewish urge to dominate non-Jews in accordance with the Talmud, continues, to describe \u201cwhat may be done / With impunity, and without conscience, / By a Chosen people, / To the vast majority of the people / On the planet / Who were not Chosen.\u201d\n\nWalker also describes being \u201caccused of being antisemitic\u201d by a \u201cfriend / a Jewish soul / who I thought understood / or could learn to understand / almost anything\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to her ex-husband. The poem includes a link to an interview she conducted with controversial Israeli pro-Palestinian activist Miko Peled.\n\nWalker\u2019s troubles with antisemitism would break into public view the following year, when The New York Times Book Review asked her to list her favorite books for a regular column. Among her choices was \u201cAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free,\u201d by antisemitic conspiracy theorist David Icke. The book purports to explore the secret forces behind global power, and contains numerous screeds on Israel, the Jews, and familiar conspiracy theories like the Rotshchild family.\n\n\u201cI believe that researchers over the years who have blamed the entire conspiracy on the Jewish people as a whole are seriously misguided; similarly, for Jewish organizations to deny that any Jewish person is working for the New World Order conspiracy is equally naive and allowing dogma or worse to blind them to reality,\u201d Icke writes at one point in the book. Later, discussing the events that led up to the Holocaust, he states, \u201cI believe that all this was coldly calculated by the \u2018Jewish\u2019 elite.\u201d\n\nWalker had nothing but praise for the book, telling the TImes, \u201cIn Icke\u2019s books there is the whole of existence, on this planet and several others, to think about. A curious person\u2019s dream come true.\u201d It wasn\u2019t her first time praising Icke, whom she has also boosted on her website and in other writings; she soon suggested that her critics were merely upset over her pro-Palestinian activism.\n\nWalker\u2019s outspoken love of Icke has prompted a more widespread reckoning with her beliefs on Jews. Last year, a book festival in Berkeley, California, disinvited her from a major event over what the festival said was her \u201cendorsement of antisemitic conspiracy theorist David Icke.\u201d Walker had been promoting \u201cGathering Blossoms Under Fire,\u201d a newly published collection of her journals. Playhouses staging \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d started publishing statements addressing Walker\u2019s links to antisemitism.\n\nA new \u2018Color\u2019 with shades of old\n\nThe new \u201cColor Purple\u201d is marketing itself as a \u201cbold\u201d reimagining of the novel, swapping out its dour, punishing prose for splashy, elaborate choreography. Like the first Spielberg adaptation, it also features an all-star Black cast: in this case headlined by Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P. Henson, \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d\u2019s Halle Bailey and musician H.E.R.\n\nIt is also being positioned by studio Warner Brothers Discovery as a major awards contender \u2014 notable as the Spielberg-directed version was famously shut out of all 10 Oscars it was nominated for. At the time, film critic Roger Ebert, who named Spielberg\u2019s film the best of the year, suspected this was due to the racism of a nearly entirely white Academy.\n\nIn the midst of Israel\u2019s ongoing war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Walker has continued to advocate for Palestinians. Last month she appeared in a webinar hosted by Socialist Action entitled \u201cPalestine Will Be Free From the River to the Sea\u201c that also featured an editor of the anti-Zionist website Electronic Intifada.\n\nMeanwhile, Spielberg\u2019s Shoah Foundation has launched an initiative to collect testimony from Israeli survivors of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. Spielberg himself, while not directly involved in the project, has endorsed it, saying, \u201cI never imagined I would see such unspeakable barbarity against Jews in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nSpielberg has made no public comments about Walker or the new \u201cColor Purple\u201d this year, though the two of them both walked the red carpet at the film\u2019s premiere.",

    "articleBody": "Pope Francis lamented war in the land of the birth of Jesus on Sunday, where Christmas Eve brought only fresh bloodshed and an intensification of fighting across the length of the Gaza Strip. Hours before midnight tolled for Christmas in the Holy Land, Palestinian health officials reported at least 70 dead in an Israeli airstrike on central Gaza. The Israeli military spokesperson's office said it was looking into the report.\n\nIsrael reported the highest two-day death toll for its troops in more than a month. The head of the Islamic Jihad militant group joined talks in Cairo, one small sign at least that diplomacy remained alive.\n\nBut in Bethlehem, the Israeli-occupied Palestinian West Bank city where Jesus Christ is believed to have been born in a stable 2,000 years ago, clergy cancelled traditional celebrations for the first time in memory. \"Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,\" Pope Francis said, presiding at Christmas Eve Mass in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n\nPalestinian Christians earlier held a Christmas vigil in Bethlehem with candle-lit hymns and prayers for peace in Gaza instead of the usual celebrations. There was no large tree, the usual centrepiece of Bethlehem's Christmas celebrations. Nativity figurines in churches were placed amid rubble and barbed wire in solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nIn the latest massive airstrike, health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said at least 70 Palestinians were killed and several houses damaged in central Gaza's Maghazi area on Sunday night. He said many were women and children. Since a week-long truce collapsed at the start of the month, fighting has only intensified on the ground, with war spreading from the north of the Gaza Strip to the full length of the enclave.\n\n'DIFFICULT DAY' The Israeli military said 10 of its soldiers had been killed in the past day, following five killed the previous day, its worst two-day losses since early November.\n\n\"This is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday. \"The war is exacting a very heavy cost from us; however we have no choice (but) to continue to fight.\" In a later video message he said troops would fight on deeper into Gaza until \"total victory\" over Hamas, adding: \"We are doing everything to safeguard the lives of our warriors.\"\n\nIsrael has been under intensifying pressure in recent weeks from its closest ally the United States to scale down its military campaign and reduce civilian deaths. The Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but blames Hamas for operating in densely populated areas or using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\n\nOn Friday, Washington withheld its veto from a U.N. Security Council resolution on the war, allowing the measure to pass after language calling for an immediate halt to hostilities was watered down. Separate diplomatic efforts, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, on a new truce to free remaining hostages held by militants in Gaza have yielded little public progress, although Washington described the talks last week as \"very serious\".\n\nIslamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied to Hamas, said a delegation led by its exiled leader Ziad al-Nakhlala was in Cairo on Sunday. His arrival followed talks attended by Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in recent days. The militant groups have so far said they will not discuss any release of hostages unless Israel ends its war in Gaza, while the Israelis say they are willing to discuss only a temporary pause in fighting.\n\nThe Cairo talks would centre on \"ways to end the Israeli aggression on our people\", said an Islamic Jihad official. The delegation would reaffirm the group's position that any exchange of hostages will have to secure the release of all Palestinians jailed in Israel, \"after a ceasefire is achieved\", the official said.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad, both sworn to Israel's destruction, are still believed to be holding more than 100 hostages from among 240 they captured during their Oct. 7 rampage through Israeli towns, when they killed 1,200 people. Since then, Israel has besieged the Gaza Strip and laid much of it to waste, with more than 20,400 people confirmed killed, according to authorities in Hamas-ruled Gaza, and thousands more are believed dead under the rubble. The vast majority of the 2.3 million Gazans have been driven from their homes and the United Nations says conditions are catastrophic.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel's military chief of staff said his forces had largely achieved operational control in the north of Gaza and would expand operations further in the south. But residents say fighting has only intensified in northern districts, notably Jabalia which Israeli forces were pounding with air strikes overnight and into Sunday. Tanks had moved further into the town on Saturday.\n\nIn the central part of the Gaza Strip, medics said six Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Bureij, where the Israeli army ordered people to evacuate and head west towards Deir Al-Balah city. Joudat Imad, 55, a father-of-six, had to leave an area in Nusseirat in central Gaza after a map published by the army marked it as a place people had to evacuate.\n\n\"I was lucky to get a tent in Rafah,\" he told Reuters by phone. \"From an owner of two buildings to a refugee in a tent awaiting aid - that is what this brutal war has turned us to. The world is sick and inhumane that it can't see Israel's brutality and it is helpless to stop this war of destruction and starvation.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Soldiers\u2019 deaths are a sensitive and emotional topic in Israel, a country with compulsory military service for most Jews.\n\nThe names of fallen soldiers are announced at the top of hourly newscasts, and in a small country of about nine million people, virtually every family knows a relative, friend or co-worker who has lost a family member in war.\n\nThe 14 Israeli soldiers killed on Friday and Saturday died in battles in central and southern Gaza, an indication of how Hamas is still putting up tough resistance against advancing Israeli troops, even as Israel claims to have dealt a serious blow to the militant group.\n\nAccording to Israeli Army Radio, four soldiers were killed when their vehicle was struck by an anti-tank missile. The others were killed in separate, sporadic fighting.\n\nAnother soldier was killed in northern Israel by fire from the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, which has kept up low-level fighting with Israel since the war with Hamas erupted, raising fears of a wider regional conflict.\n\nTheir deaths bring the number of Israeli soldiers killed since the ground offensive began to 153.\n\nTens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed (AP)\n\nEven if Israelis have been supportive of the war effort, there has been widespread anger against the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which many criticise for failing to protect civilians on October 7 and promoting policies that allowed Hamas to gain strength over the years.\n\nOn Saturday night, thousands of people demonstrated in pouring rain in Tel Aviv, chanting \u201cBibi, Bibi, we don\u2019t want you any more\u201d, referring to Mr Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nThe Israeli Prime Minister has avoided claiming responsibility for the military and policy failures leading up to October 7, saying he would answer tough questions once the fighting is over.\n\nOn Saturday, Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said forces were expanding their offensive in northern and southern Gaza and troops were fighting in \u201ccomplex areas\u201d in Khan Younis, Gaza\u2019s second-largest city, where Israel believes Hamas leaders are hiding.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a Cabinet meeting: \u201cThe war exacts a very heavy price from us but we have no choice but to continue fighting.\u201d\n\nThere has been widespread anger against Mr Netanyahu\u2019s government, which many criticise for failing to protect civilians on October 7 and promoting policies that allowed Hamas to gain strength over the years.\n\nMr Netanyahu has avoided accepting responsibility for the military and policy failures.\n\nAn Israeli Apache helicopter fires flares over the Gaza Strip (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)\n\nMeanwhile, efforts towards another ceasefire continued.\n\nOn Sunday, the head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group also involved in the October 7 attack, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, arrived in Cairo for talks.\n\nThe militant group said it was prepared to consider releasing hostages only after a ceasefire.\n\nHamas\u2019 top leader Ismail Haniyeh travelled to Cairo for talks days earlier.\n\nEgypt and Qatar have been key mediators in the conflict.\n\nIsrael\u2019s offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history and has claimed a staggering toll on Palestinian civilians. More than two-thirds of the 20,000 killed were women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said Sunday morning that a 13-year-old boy was shot and killed by an Israeli drone attack while inside the building of al-Amal hospital, which is run by the charity, in Khan Younis.\n\nThe current conflict is having an unspeakable impact on civilians.

Israel has launched thousands of airstrikes since October 7, and has largely refrained from commenting on specific attacks.\n\nThe mounting casualties on both sides came days after the United Nations Security Council passed a watered-down resolution calling for the speedy delivery of humanitarian aid for hungry and desperate Palestinians and the release of all the hostages, but not for a ceasefire.\n\nFollowing the UN resolution, it was not immediately clear how and when aid deliveries would accelerate. Trucks enter through two crossings \u2014 Rafah on the border with Egypt and Kerem Shalom on the border with Israel.

His arrival followed talks attended by Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in recent days.\n\nThe militant groups have so far said they will not discuss any release of hostages unless Israel ends its war in Gaza, while the Israelis say they are willing to discuss only a temporary pause in fighting.\n\nThe delegation would reaffirm the group\u2019s position that any exchange of hostages will have to secure the release of all Palestinians jailed in Israel, \u201cafter a ceasefire is achieved,\u201d the official said.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad, both sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction, are still believed to be holding more than 100 hostages from among 240 they captured during their October 7 rampage through Israeli towns, when they killed 1,200 people.\n\nSince then, Israel has besieged Gaza and laid much of it to waste, with more than 20,400 people confirmed killed, according to authorities in Hamas-ruled Gaza, and thousands more are believed dead under the rubble.\n\nThe vast majority of the 2.3 million Gazans have been driven from their homes and the United Nations says conditions are catastrophic.\n\nThree Israeli hostages appear in footage by Hamas at a location given as Gaza, in this still image obtained from video released on December 18. Photo: Hamas Military Wing / Handout via Reuters\n\nFive Israeli hostages killed in Hamas captivity were recovered from an underground tunnel network in northern Gaza, the military said on Sunday, showing footage of a white-tiled bathroom and work room linked by dark concrete-lined passages.\n\nThe publication left open the question of how they had died, with chief military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari saying postmortems were pending. \u201cWe will brief the families and then, depending on what they approve, the public,\u201d he said.\n\nThe three soldiers and two civilians were among 240 people dragged back to Gaza by Hamas gunmen during the cross-border rampage of October 7 that sparked the war . The military announced the repatriation of their bodies earlier this month.\n\nHamas last week published video showing three of the hostages alive in what appeared to be a narrow, white-tiled and windowless bedroom with an electric wall socket.\n\nIn a Hebrew chyron directed at Israel, the Iranian-backed Islamist group said: \u201cYour military weapons killed the three.\u201d\n\nHamas has previously said some hostages died in Israel\u2019s shelling of Gaza. It has also threatened to execute hostages.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press",

These strikes, part of the escalating conflict in the region, raise questions and fears about the future of this fragile geopolitical hotspot.\n\nA New Day, A New Strike\n\nAt approximately 7:00 a.m. today, the silence of Aitaroun was shattered by hostile artillery shelling from enemy positions within the occupied Palestinian territories. Israeli artillery forces targeted the town, causing potential casualties and significant damage. The strikes are another grim chapter in the ongoing conflicts in the region, often characterized by the presence of foreign military forces and territorial disputes.\n\nCountering Fire with Fire\n\nAs the dust settled in Aitaroun, the militant group Hezbollah retaliated with explosive drones and missiles, escalating tensions further. Israel\u2019s response to these retaliations has been swift and severe, with air strikes rocking several towns and villages in south Lebanon. So far, the violence has claimed the lives of over 120 people in Lebanon, including 85 Hezbollah fighters and 16 civilians. On the Israeli side, seven soldiers and four civilians have lost their lives.\n\nThe Struggle for Peace\n\nDespite the violence and rising tensions, efforts towards peace continue. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) remains dedicated to maintaining a buffer between Israeli and Lebanese forces. In addition, US President Biden has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt pre-emptive strikes against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon to prevent a wider regional war. As the situation unfolds, the world watches with bated breath, hoping for a peaceful resolution.\n\nGeeta Pillai Geeta Pillai is a renowned international correspondent with a keen focus on global economics and politics.

    "articleBody": "Pope Francis has kicked off global Christmas celebrations with a call for peace, as Israel's war on Hamas and Russia's invasion of Ukraine cast a shadow over one of the world's favourite holidays.\n\nHaving said earlier in the day that he was thinking of people \"who are suffering from war -- we are thinking of Palestine, of Israel, of Ukraine\", the pope struck a sombre tone during his Christmas Eve mass.\n\n\"Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,\" the pope said.\n\nThe biblical city in the occupied West Bank, where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born in a stable more than 2,000 years ago, effectively cancelled the annual Christmas celebrations that normally draw thousands of tourists.\n\nThe town did away with its giant Christmas tree, marching bands and flamboyant nativity scene this year, settling for just a few festive lights.\n\nIn the centre of town, a huge Palestinian flag had been unfolded with a banner declaring that \"The bells of Bethlehem ring for a ceasefire in Gaza\".\n\n\"A lot of people are dying for this land,\" said Nicole Najjar, an 18-year-old student.\n\n\"It's really hard to celebrate while our people are dying.\"\n\nThe Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said: \"We are here to pray and to ask not only for a ceasefire, a ceasefire is not enough, we have to stop these hostilities and to turn the page because violence generates only violence\".\n\nSister Nabila Salah from the Catholic Holy Church in Gaza -- where two Christian women were killed by an Israeli sniper earlier this month, according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem -- told AFP \"all Christmas celebrations have been cancelled\".\n\n\"How do we celebrate when we are... hearing the sound of tanks and bombardment instead of the ringing of bells?\" she said.\n\nIn Syria, churches limited celebrations to prayers in solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 left around 1,140 people dead in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest official Israeli figures.\n\nThe Palestinian militants also abducted around 250 people, 129 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.\n\nIsrael retaliated with a sustained bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, where 20,424 people have been killed, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\n- New Christmas Day -\n\nUkraine, invaded by Russia nearly two years ago, is celebrating Christmas on December 25 for the first time, jettisoning the traditional Orthodox date of January 7, which is feted in Russia, as a snub to Moscow.\n\nIn the southern Black Sea port of Odesa, churchgoers prayed and lit candles as priests in gold vestments held a Christmas Eve service in the Cathedral of the Nativity, decorated with fir trees and a nativity scene.\n\n\"We believe that we really should celebrate Christmas with the whole world, far away, far away from Moscow. For me that's the new message now,\" said one smiling parishioner, Olena, whose son is a medic on the front line.\n\nThe date change -- moving away from the Julian calendar favoured by the Orthodox Church -- is part of moves since the invasion to remove traces of the Russian and Soviet empires.\n\n- Surfing Santas -\n\nIn countries not afflicted by war, festive revellers donned Santa hats for a shot of holiday cheer -- running a city race in Skopje, North Macedonia; surfing the waves in Florida; jogging along muddy wooded paths on the outskirts of Paris; dipping in the sea near the British port of Dover; or soaking with a drink in hand in Lake Geneva.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, where the big day had already arrived, many residents and tourists headed to the beach, wearing the woolly red hats despite the heat in the Southern Hemisphere's summer.\n\nAnd children around the globe followed Santa, his reindeer and their present-laden sleigh with the help of Norad Tracks Santa, a 3-D interactive website run annually by a joint US-Canadian military monitoring agency.\n\n- Prayers in Turkey -\n\nIn southern Turkey, much of which was devastated by an earthquake in February, some faithful celebrated mass in front of the ruins of their church at Antakya.\n\n\"It's important for us to celebrate the birth of Jesus. but it's a very sad Christmas,\" said Vehbi Tadrasgil, a 55-year-old who lost his wife and two of his three children in the quake that killed at least 50,000 people in Turkey and more than 5,000 in neighbouring Syria.\n\n\"I hope that their souls are here, I am certain that our prayers rise to them,\" he said.\n\nTwenty kilometres (12 miles) down the coast in Samandag, a generator powered the lights on a tree in front of the Saint-Ilyas church, which survived.\n\n\"After the earthquake, our community -- 400 families -- was annihilated. With this Christmas, we want to wish everyone rebirth, love, joy and peace. We must move forward, rebuild a new life,\" said Father Yumurta.\n\n\"They say that with the birth of the child Jesus, a new life begins, a new beginning. For us too, here, it will be a new beginning,\" he said.\n\nburs/yad/jj/leg/mtp",

    "articleBody": "For us retail investors, perhaps the most remarkable feature of 2023 was how little influence climatic and political events wielded over markets. Like a scared rabbit blinking into the headlights of an approaching car, we looked at rapidly rising, damage-foreboding interest rates all over the world, tectonic shifts in exchange rates, and the often announced and never yet arriving recession, despite the visible deterioration of the economy on many fronts. It was mainly the spending power of the US consumer which kept us going, with a lot of spare cash on hands, in the face of hardening financial conditions and painfully shrinking liquidity.\n\nTwo massive wars had little effect on market gyrations: the ongoing, meat-grinding stalemate in Ukraine and the vast destruction dealt out in the Gaza strip, a dire open-air prison for two million Palestinians squeezed behind barbed wire and locked out of the world by Egypt and Israel. A friend of mine, working as a war reporter for a major TV station, who had spent the last six weeks in Israel, remarked at a dinner party that in all his decades as a war reporter, he has never seen such an extent of rubble and utter obliteration. Comparable perhaps only to Russia\u2019s annihilation of Grozny, the Chechen capital turned to dust by bombing raids.\n\nIn Europe, even major political events changed little. Geerd Wilders, the fiercely anti-Muslim, anti-immigration buffoon, won a majority in parliament but will struggle to form a government, with all other parties refusing to put up with his antics. Portugal\u2019s Prime Minister Antonio Costa had to resign amid corruption allegations, but its economy is doing fine. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez secured his leadership by pardoning Catalan separatists and hence gaining their party\u2019s support \u2013 to the dismay of many. Polish voters denied the far-right PiS party of Kacynski the parliament majority, smoothing the way for the Europe-friendly, law-respecting Donald Tusk into government, if only president Duda would allow him.\n\nAt the time of writing, it was still wait and see. Malta has to suffer a cynical, law-bending and corruption-tainted government until 2027, with little chance of the out-of-touch, ratty Nationalist opposition to ever gain traction with voters. The British conservatives are on their way out, with after-Brexit migration hitting all-time highs and the cost-of-living crisis spreading. Germany, one of the least-indebted, rich nations, is suffering a self-inflicted budget crisis, unable to invest in its future. Greece, the mutilated victim of the Great Financial Crisis, is excelling economically, while politically displaying an image of calm. In Italy, the much-dreaded, supposedly far-right Georgia Meloni acts like a seasoned liberal.\n\nWe know by now that 2023 was the hottest year on record. As emission reduction targets envisaged at the Paris Climate Summit in 2015 are clearly out of reach, we are heading into a world of cataclysmic weather events and unbearable heat. Increasingly we started to focus on how to adapt, rather than to avoid climate Armageddon. This year\u2019s climate conference took place in Dubai, headed by UAE\u2019s prime minister, who wasted no time securing lucrative oil deals in side talks. The symbolism of one of the biggest oil exporters parading as a climate saver did not go unnoticed. It looks as if the whole world is going the Malta way.\n\nInflation in the world\u2019s biggest economies is coming down. Last month saw Europe\u2019s inflation falling to 2.4%. \u201cTeam Transitory\u201d, all the economists and financial pundits who argued that rampant inflation was more supply-induced than fuelled by rampant consumption, look all of a sudden prescient. Who knows? Nevertheless, last month saw most stock exchanges rising enthusiastically and bond values going up. Perhaps there\u2019s no recession after all.\n\nIn November, Charly Munger died at the age of 99 \u2013 just short of his 100th birthday. Munger was Warren Buffett\u2019s \u201csidekick\u201d, his indispensable partner in the most successful, consistent investment undertaking in history. Their investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway, worth close to $800 billion today, saw its share price multiplying from $19 in 1965 \u2013 the time Warren Buffett took over \u2013 to $545,900 today. This is, according to my HP calculator, a gain of 2,873.058%. Sadly, even a single share is unaffordable for most of us.\n\nMaltese shares are a gamble on Malta\u2019s economic success - Andreas Weitzer\n\nA reader once asked me why I never focus my investment interest on Maltese stocks. I answered that Maltese shares are a gamble on Malta\u2019s economic success. As I live and work in Malta, I am already fully exposed to its economy, willy-nilly. Hence my need to diversify. But even to an outsider, there\u2019s little to attract interest. The Malta Stock Exchange index has gained 7.28% year to date, but lost 17.36% in five years. This is worse than the pummelled Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite, which lost only 1.87% in five years. Maltese shares with a price/earnings valuation of 10.25 are that cheap for a reason.\n\nAdmittedly, my own investments, which I evaluate on a US dollar basis, have not fared much better over the last year. This has reasons beyond merely bad stock-picking. Some of my investments are held in currencies which fared badly, like the Japanese Yen. A third of my portfolio consists of bonds, which have suffered great losses with rising interest rates. And some of my bonds were issued by Russian emitters and hence of no worth. A gain of 7.35% over the last year looks Maltese, but my investments are at least up 13% over five years.\n\nWith hindsight, it would have been far better to put all my money in the US S&P 500 Index. American shares have gained 13.9% year on year (a gain of 18.97% including dividends) and 73.48% over five years. This was almost exclusively due to Big Tech. If the S&P Index would have been structured giving equal weight to all constituents of the Index, as opposed to market capitalisation, which favours always the biggest companies, the S&P Index would have been down year to date. The Japanese Nikkei Index, up 20.97% in the last year, has seen a much broader industrial revival. Again, it was Buffett who had seen it all coming. His bet on five, big Japanese trading houses is up 183.33% according to insiders.\n\nBetting on Big Tech in time would have made me a millionaire. But even here, pitfalls loomed. What was long hailed as the FAANGs (analysts love catchy acronyms) \u2013 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google \u2013 has since last year coalesced into The Magnificent Seven. Google is now called Alphabet, Facebook Meta, while Netflix has lost its place on the table for good. The \u201cSeven\u201d are Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and the \u201cnewcomers\u201d Nvidia, Microsoft and Tesla. These companies are boosted by their \u201cbroad moat\u201d (Buffett) \u2013 a euphemism for anti-competitive, monopolistic dominance, the growing importance of cloud services and the recent advances in artificial intelligence, popularised by ChatGPT.\n\nA concentrated investment in the Magnificent Seven would have yielded 73.55% in the last year alone, or an astounding 432.39% in the last five years. We know this now. But who knows what 2024 will bring? Perhaps the Dirty Dozen? A US President called Donald Trump? Conflict with China? The long-expected recession? The AfD ruling Germany? The absolution of Konrad Mizzi and Yorgen Fenech? Let\u2019s hope for the better. I wish all readers a happy and prosperous 2024. And us retail investors the wisdom to profit in confusing times.",

Both men believe such a move would benefit Hamas.\n\nOn Friday, the UN Security Council approved a resolution demanding large-scale aid deliveries to Gaza - but this, too, stopped short of calling for a ceasefire between the two warring sides.\n\nTalks held in Egypt earlier this week designed to secure a fresh truce between Israel and Hamas have so far failed to deliver results.\n\nA Palestinian official familiar with the ceasefire negotiations told the BBC that Egypt presented a new three-stage plan that would begin with a two-week humanitarian truce - which could be extended - during which Hamas would release 40 hostages and Israel would release 120 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThis stage would be followed by the formation of an independent body to deal with humanitarian relief and reconstruction, as well as a comprehensive ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners.\n\nThe Israeli military has kept up its bombing campaign in Gaza - ordering civilians to flee. The UN said the latest evacuation order affected 150,000 people in the middle of the territory.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel said 700 Palestinian militants had been arrested during its ground offensive to date.\n\nIt also said one of its fighter jets had killed Hassah Atrash, a man it accused of smuggling weapons into Gaza to arm Hamas. There has been no confirmation from Hamas.\n\nThe Israeli military has said it has almost full operational control of the north of the Gaza Strip, and is stepping up operations elsewhere.\n\nA spokesman has said troops are entering new Hamas strongholds in southern areas.\n\nBriefing his cabinet on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu denied suggestions the US president had persuaded him against further expanding his military operation.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal had reported that Mr Netanyahu had been talked out of attacking Hamas's ally in Lebanon, the Hezbollah group.\n\nA government spokesperson told the BBC \"the situation in the north... is intolerable\" and that Israel was \"trying to deter Hezbollah from dragging us into a war\".\n\n\"We will continue making the necessary preparations to repel this threat from the northern border,\" he added.\n\n* This story was first published by the BBC.",

For me that's the new message now,\" said one smiling parishioner, Olena, whose son is a medic on the front line.\n\nThe date change -- moving away from the Julian calendar favoured by the Orthodox Church -- is part of moves since the invasion to remove traces of the Russian and Soviet empires.\n\n- Surfing Santas -\n\nIn countries not afflicted by war, festive revellers donned Santa hats for a shot of holiday cheer -- running a city race in Skopje, North Macedonia; surfing the waves in Florida; jogging along muddy wooded paths on the outskirts of Paris; dipping in the sea near the British port of Dover; or soaking with a drink in hand in Lake Geneva.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, where the big day had already arrived, many residents and tourists headed to the beach, wearing the woolly red hats despite the heat in the Southern Hemisphere's summer.\n\nAnd children around the globe followed Santa, his reindeer and their present-laden sleigh with the help of Norad Tracks Santa, a 3-D interactive website run annually by a joint US-Canadian military monitoring agency.\n\nPrayers in Turkey\n\nIn southern Turkey, much of which was devastated by an earthquake in February, some faithful celebrated mass in front of the ruins of their church at Antakya.\n\n\"It's important for us to celebrate the birth of Jesus. but it's a very sad Christmas,\" said Vehbi Tadrasgil, a 55-year-old who lost his wife and two of his three children in the quake that killed at least 50,000 people in Turkey and more than 5,000 in neighbouring Syria.\n\n\"I hope that their souls are here, I am certain that our prayers rise to them,\" he said.\n\nTwenty kilometres (12 miles) down the coast in Samandag, a generator powered the lights on a tree in front of the Saint-Ilyas church, which survived.\n\n\"After the earthquake, our community -- 400 families -- was annihilated. With this Christmas, we want to wish everyone rebirth, love, joy and peace. We must move forward, rebuild a new life,\" said Father Yumurta.",

    "articleBody": "Hamas Ally Engages in Talks with Egyptian Officials Amid Ongoing Conflict\n\nIn a recent development, a delegation from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), an ally of Hamas, has arrived in Cairo, Egypt, to engage in talks with Egyptian security officials. As reported by Reuters, the purpose and agenda of the discussions have not been explicitly stated. These talks mark a continuation of Egypt\u2019s historical role as an intermediary in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, often facilitating negotiations, ceasefires, and dialogues between different Palestinian factions and Israel.\n\nThe PIJ, Hamas, and Egypt: Delicate Diplomacy\n\nThe PIJ\u2019s arrival in Cairo for these talks highlights the ongoing complexities and diplomatic efforts in the region. The discussions are expected to focus on ending Israeli aggression, prisoner-swap deals, and possibly the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. Historically, Egypt has often offered proposals for truces and the release of hostages in conflicts involving Hamas and Israel.\n\nConflict and Casualties: The Human Cost\n\nThe recent conflict between Hamas, the PIJ, and Israel has resulted in a significant loss of life. The Gaza Health Ministry reported a particularly deadly airstrike on the Maghzi refugee camp in central Gaza. The devastation of this conflict extends beyond immediate casualties: thousands have been driven from their homes, and the region faces catastrophic conditions.\n\nDiplomatic Efforts: A Quest for Peace\n\nEfforts to negotiate a truce and secure the release of hostages have been ongoing. Egypt and Qatar have been particularly active in trying to mediate a new truce and secure the release of remaining hostages held by militants in Gaza. This diplomatic endeavour, however, has so far made little public progress. The militant groups have stated that they will not discuss the release of hostages unless Israel ends its military offensive in Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has expressed a willingness to discuss only a temporary pause in the fighting.\n\nIn conclusion, the arrival of the PIJ delegation in Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials underscores the ongoing diplomatic efforts and complexities in the region. With Egypt\u2019s continued involvement in peacekeeping and negotiation efforts, the world watches closely as the next chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict unfolds.\n\nHadeel Hashem Hadeel Hashem is an internationally acclaimed journalist recognized for her profound dedication to climate change and environmental reporting.

MOHAMMED ABED/AFP\n\nCAIRO/JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel said its armed forces were increasingly focused on Hamas targets in south Gaza on Sunday, after the UN Security Council appealed for more aid for the enclave.\n\nSignaling a pivot after weeks of intensive fighting around Gaza City, the Israeli army said troops were now looking to the Hamas stronghold of Khan Younis and elsewhere in the south, where most displaced Palestinians are trapped.\n\nThe refugee camp-turned-city is the birthplace and power base of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's chief military spokesperson said on Saturday that its forces had achieved almost complete operational control of northern Gaza and were preparing to expand the ground offensive to other areas in the strip, with a focus on the south.\n\nMore than a dozen Israeli soldiers were killed in combat over the weekend, the Israeli military said, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that the conflict in Gaza was exacting a \"very heavy price\".\n\nUS President Joe Biden discussed the situation with Netanyahu on Saturday. Israel's main ally has kept up its support while expressing concern over the growing casualty toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\nBiden declined to detail his conversation with Netanyahu, telling reporters it was a \"private conversation.\" But, he added: \"I did not ask for a cease-fire.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu talked in detail about Israeli military operations in Gaza, including \"its objectives and phasing\", the need to protect civilian lives and securing the release of hostages being held captive, the White House said.\n\nUS officials have said they want and expect Israel soon to shift its military operations in Gaza to a lower-intensity phase during which there will be more targeted operations focused on the Hamas leadership and its infrastructure.\n\nUN vote\n\nAfter days of wrangling to avert a threatened US veto, the UN Security Council on Friday passed a resolution urging steps to allow \"safe, unhindered, and expanded humanitarian access\" to Gaza and \"conditions for a sustainable cessation\" of fighting.\n\nThe resolution was toned down from earlier drafts that called for an immediate end to 11 weeks of conflict and diluting Israeli control over aid deliveries, clearing the way for the vote in which the United States abstained.\n\nThe proposed resolution, presented by the United Arab Emirates, garnered support from 13 council members.\n\nChristians held a somber Christmas vigil in Bethlehem in the West Bank on Saturday, with candle-lit hymns and prayers for peace in Gaza instead of the usual festive celebrations.\n\nMost years Bethlehem basks in the central place it holds in the Christian story of Jesus' life.\n\nBut with Israel's campaign in Gaza, this year people in Bethlehem decided to have no large tree, the usual centerpiece of Christmas celebrations.\n\nSyrians also canceled Christmas festivities in solidarity with Gaza. Aleppo's central district of Azizia is usually home to a bustling festive market and a huge Christmas tree, while its streets are adorned with lights and trinkets. But this year, the main square is almost empty and there are no Christmas decorations in sight.\n\nAgencies - Xinhua",

    "articleBody": "LONDON - This year might go down as one of the most unusual ever in financial markets - mainly because everything seems to have come good despite a lot of turbulence and many predictions turning out to be wrong.\n\nTake equity markets. World stocks are nearly 20% higher despite the highest interest rates in decades and a mini crisis that wiped out one of Europe's best known banks - Credit Suisse - along with a few smaller ones in the U.S.\n\nIn the bond markets, just a few months ago investors were expecting the Fed & Co to raise rates and leave them there while recessions rolled in. Now bond markets are looking to central banks to embark on a rate-cutting spree with inflation apparently beaten.\n\nOther areas of the markets have experienced wild gyrations that are hard to explain. Bitcoin is up 150% on the year. The most beaten up emerging market bonds have achieved triple-digit gains. The \"magnificent seven\" tech giants have seen a 99% surge in their shares over the year.\n\n\"If you'd told me at the start of year that we would have a U.S. regional banking crisis and Credit Suisse would cease to exist, then I'm not sure we would have guessed that we would see the year we've had for risk assets,\" PIMCO's CIO for Global Fixed Income, Andrew Balls, said.\n\nThe result has been 3.5% - 6.5% returns from top government bonds and a $10 trillion rally in world stocks , although that has been top heavy.\n\nMeta and Tesla have soared 190% and 105%. The Nasdaq is on the cusp of its strongest year in two decades, while AI's demand for semiconductor chips has catapulted Nvidia 240% higher into the $1 trillion dollar club.\n\nBut it has been a very bumpy ride.\n\nIn March, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a mid-sized U.S. lender, and the rescue of 167-year-old Credit Suisse triggered a slide in world shares where they lost all of the 10% gains made in January.\n\nThe scramble for safety pushed gold up 7% and U.S. and European government bond yields - the main drivers of global borrowing costs - recorded their biggest monthly drop since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe steady climb in interest rates around the world kept investors on edge through the summer, and in October Hamas' attacks in Israel ratcheted up geopolitical tensions.\n\nROUND-TRIPPING\n\nIn the forex markets, the dollar is down a barely-noticeable 1% on the year. But Japan's seeming reluctance to raise interest rates and China's sputtering economy mean the yen and yuan are down 9% and 3.5% respectively.\n\nAs usual, the big moves have been in emerging markets.\n\nTurkey's efforts to tackle its economic problems following Tayyip Erdogan's re-election have not been made any easier by another 35% dive in the lira.\n\nEgypt has devalued its currency 20%, Nigeria has cut the naira by 45% and Argentina's new president Javier Milei has just slashed the peso in half.\n\nOn the upside, Colombia and Mexico's pesos are up 23% and 14%. Poland's zloty is up 11%, followed by Brazil's real which is up 8.5%. And of the major currencies, the safe-haven Swiss franc has been the strongest performer up 7.5%.\n\n\"Once the dollar starts to move down there could be a lot of fuel for that to continue,\" DoubleLine's Bill Campbell said, referring to a potential weakening of the dollar and also questioning what a potential return to power by Donald Trump might mean.\n\nOne of the most remarkable round trips is that the key 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will end the 2023 almost exactly where it started despite touching 5% in October.\n\nBofA calculates that the battle against inflation has produced around 125 interest rate hikes globally this year versus 60 cuts.\n\nIf the previous 18 months are added the total is 510 hikes compared with just over 1,370 cuts since the global financial crash in 2008. And cuts will start to dominate next year with roughly 150 now expected compared with 40 hikes.\n\n\"Everyone expects a soft landing to happen, everyone expects bond yields to be lower and everyone expects Fed rate cuts,\" BofA strategist Elyas Galou said, highlighting the group think the bank's investor surveys showed.\n\nThe big discrepancy though is that the Fed has only cut rates when unemployment is as low as it now five times the last 90 years.\n\nELECTION FEVER\n\nJapan's Nikkei has surged 17% in dollar terms, or 27% in yen terms, setting it up for its best year in a decade.\n\nProperty woes have continued to drag on China, which has had a knock-on impact on oil, which is down almost 8% on the year. Gold has jumped 11.5%.\n\nOther standouts include El Salvador bonds, which are now battling out of default and have returned 114% on the year.\n\nU.S. sanctions relief has seen Venezuela's bonds vault 150% and Pakistan and Sri Lanka's have made 97% and 71%.\n\nNext year won't be quiet on the political front.\n\nThere are more than 50 major elections scheduled next year, including in the United States, Taiwan, India, Mexico, Russia and probably Britain. That means countries that contribute 80% of world market cap and 60% of global GDP will be voting.\n\nTaiwan kicks it off with elections on January 13, followed just a few days later by the New Hampshire primary for the 2024 U.S. Presidential race.\n\nOther dates for the diary include the Fed's first rate cut, which is pencilled in for March 20, while OPEC and G7 meetings are scheduled for June.\n\n\"This is an era of boom and bust,\" BofA Galou said. \"We are not out of the woods.\"\n\n(Reporting by Marc Jones.

Landmark events, turning tides, and unexpected collapses marked the year, painting a diverse tableau of triumphs, trials, and tribulations.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Resilient Rebound\n\nIn a stunning reversal of fortunes from the shadow of the 2022 decline, Bitcoin, the digital currency that has disrupted financial norms, saw a remarkable 160% increase in 2023. An impending Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) sparked an air of optimism, influencing this surge. The dwindling supply, coupled with the entry of institutional investors and renewed interest in Bitcoin development, has set the stage for a potential price of $100,000 per Bitcoin in 2024.\n\n(Read Also: Biden\u2019s Diplomatic Triumph Averts Israeli-Hezbollah Clash in Middle East Crisis)\n\nThe AI Lifeline in Turbulent Times\n\nAs technology continues to redefine market dynamics, the allure of artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as a significant player.

Retail investors suffered severe losses in a speculative gamble on Bed Bath & Beyond. Similarly, professional investors who placed bets on the Chinese market with a \u2018buy-China\u2019 strategy were met with considerable setbacks.\n\nMarket Fluctuations Across Asset Classes\n\nThe financial rollercoaster of 2023 saw various asset classes experiencing contrasting fates. While some, like bank bonds and cryptocurrencies, witnessed explosive growth, others suffered unexpected downturns. The dramatic collapse of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange led by Sam Bankman-Fried, served as a stark reminder of the volatility of the financial world.\n\n(Read Also: UN Security Council\u2019s Gaza Aid Resolution Criticized for Absence of Ceasefire Call)\n\nBeyond Silicon Valley: Tech Advancements and Economic Indicators\n\nIn addition to the market dynamics, 2023 also saw noteworthy developments outside of Silicon Valley, signifying the broadening horizons of technological advancements. On the economic front, indicators such as a cooling of U.S. inflation and the Bank of Japan\u2019s monetary policy stance provided critical insights into the global financial sphere.\n\nAs the year concludes, it leaves behind a mixed bag of financial narratives, each echoing the resilience, ambition, and unpredictability that characterize the global markets.\n\nRead More\n\nBNN Correspondents Founded by visionary entrepreneur Gurbaksh Chahal, BNN Newsroom has risen to prominence as a powerhouse in the international journalism landscape.

    "articleBody": "Bethlehem is normally at its busiest at Christmas, but this year war has scared away tourists and pilgrims from the Palestinian town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, leaving hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops deserted. With global headlines dominated since October 7 by news of the Hamas attacks in southern Israel, followed by Israel's military assault on Gaza and a rise in violence in the West Bank, business owners in Bethlehem said no one is coming.\n\n\"We have no guests. Not one,\" said Joey Canavati, owner of the Alexander Hotel, whose family has lived and worked in Bethlehem for four generations. \"This is the worst Christmas ever. Bethlehem is shut down for Christmas. No Christmas tree, no joy, no Christmas spirit,\" he said.\n\nALSO READ: Israel Says Bodies Of Five Hostages, Abducted During Oct 7 Attack, Found Inside Hamas Tunnel In Gaza | Watch\n\nLocated just south of Jerusalem, Bethlehem is heavily reliant for income and jobs on visitors from all over the world who come to see the Church of the Nativity, believed by Christians to stand on the site where Jesus was born.\n\nCanavati said that before October 7, his hotel was fully booked for Christmas, to the point that he was looking for rooms elsewhere in the town to help out people he could not fit in.\n\nSince the war started, everyone cancelled, including bookings for next year. \"All we get on the email is cancellation after cancellation after cancellation,\" said Canavati. He took Reuters TV on a tour of the hotel, opening doors to empty rooms and showing the silent dining room.\n\n\"We had at least 120 people having dinner here every night, and it was packed. The noise, the people. Empty. No Christmas breakfast, no Christmas dinner, no Christmas buffet,\" he said.\n\nSurge In Attacks\n\nSince the 1967 war between Israel and neighbouring Arab countries, Israel has occupied the West Bank, which Palestinians want as the core of a future independent state. Israel has built Jewish settlements, deemed illegal by most countries, across the territory. Israel disputes this, citing historical and biblical ties to the land. Several of its ministers live in settlements and favour their expansion.\n\nSince October 7, the West Bank has experienced a rise in attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinians, which were already at a 15-year high this year before the Hamas attack.\n\nBethlehem's Manger Square, a large paved space in front of the Church of the Nativity that usually serves as a focal point for Christmas celebrations, was quiet and almost empty, as were nearby streets where most souvenir shops were shuttered.\n\nRony Tabash, who sells crucifixes, statuettes of the Virgin Mary and other religious trinkets in his family's store, was tidying shelves and merchandise to pass the time.\n\n\"We are almost two months without any pilgrims, any tourists,\" he said, adding that he was keeping the store open as a way to stave off hopelessness. \"We want to feel that everything will be back, like to normal life,\" he said.\n\nAla'a Salameh, owner of falafel restaurant Afteem, said his business was operating at 10% or 15% of capacity, catering for local Palestinian families rather than the usual influx of foreign visitors.\n\nHe said he was keeping the restaurant open because his staff needed the work. \"I have workers, so from where I can give them money to take and to feed their families, their kids?\" he said.\n\n\"We are praying for peace. For peace. You know, Bethlehem is the city where peace was born, so it should be the messenger for peace to be spread all over the world,\" he added.\n\n(Note: Except for the headline, this Reuters copy has not been edited by Jagran English staff)",

    "articleBody": "Palestinian Resistance Delegation in Cairo Discusses Gaza Ceasefire\n\nRepresentatives of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad resistance movement have convened in Cairo to engage in dialogue with Egyptian officials. The discussions center on reinstituting a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and concluding Israeli aggression towards Palestinians in the region. The Islamic Jihad\u2019s Secretary-General, Ziad al-Nakhala, articulated his organization\u2019s aspiration to terminate the Gaza conflict entirely.\n\nDialogues for Peace\n\nAccording to sources within the resistance movement, the talks will address the liberation of Israeli captives and strategic approaches to halt Israeli hostilities. Israel had previously solicited mediation from Egypt and Doha for a prisoner exchange deal connected to a new humanitarian truce. This comes after an escalation of the conflict on October 7, initiated by the Hamas-led Palestinian resistance, Operation Al Aqsa Storm, in retaliation to Israeli violence.\n\n(Read Also: Unveiling Israel\u2019s Drive to Free Hostages amidst Larger Conflict)\n\nHumanitarian Crisis in Gaza\n\nThe Israeli offensive has reportedly led to over 20,000 Palestinian fatalities and in excess of 56,000 injuries. Furthermore, the Israeli regime has imposed a full siege on Gaza, depriving over two million Palestinians of essential services. A Qatari-mediated humanitarian truce, which ended on December 1, involved the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the provision of relief aid to Gaza.\n\n(Read Also: Gaza Conflict Stretches On: Unyielding Combat Amid Rising Casualties and Humanitarian Crisis)\n\nUN Resolution and Future Prospects\n\nIn recent developments, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution advocating for increased aid to Gaza but stopped short of demanding an immediate cessation of hostilities. The resolution, abstained from by the US and Russia, calls for conditions conducive to a sustainable end of hostilities. As the discussions in Cairo proceed, the Palestinian resistance movement and the international community await a decisive step towards peace in the region.\n\nRead More\n\nSakchi Khandelwal Sakchi Khandelwal is a distinguished international correspondent for BNN, known for her unwavering commitment to effecting meaningful societal change through journalism.

No Christmas tree, no decorations, no family dinner, no celebrations,\" he said while undergoing dialysis. \"I pray for this war to be over soon.\"\n\nSister Nabila Salah from the Catholic Holy Church in Gaza -- where two Christian women were killed by an Israeli sniper earlier this month according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem -- struck a sombre tone.\n\n\"All Christmas celebrations have been cancelled,\" she told AFP. \"How do we celebrate when we are... hearing the sound of tanks and bombardment instead of the ringing of bells?\"\n\nThe war broke out when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel on October 7 and killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, and seized 250 hostages, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nIsrael has vowed to eliminate Hamas in response and its military campaign, which has included massive aerial bombardment, has killed 20,424 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.\n\nPope Francis kicked off global Christmas celebrations on Sunday with a call for peace, as the war cast a shadow over one of the world's favourite holidays.\n\n\"Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,\" the Catholic leader said.\n\nThe Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, arrived Sunday at the Church of the Nativity, clad in the traditional black and white keffiyeh.\n\n\"Our heart goes to Gaza, to all people in Gaza but a special attention to our Christian community in Gaza who is suffering,\" he said.\n\n- Christmas eve strike -\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry said at least 70 people were killed in an Israeli air strike on Sunday at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza.\n\nHealth ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said the \"toll is likely to rise\" as many families were thought to be in the area at the time of the strike.\n\nIn a separate incident, the ministry said 10 members of one family were killed in an Israeli strike on their house in the Jabalia camp in northern Gaza.\n\nAFP was unable to independently verify either toll.\n\nVast areas of Gaza lie in ruins and its 2.4 million people have endured dire shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine due to an Israeli siege, alleviated only by the limited arrival of aid trucks.\n\nEighty percent of Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN, many fleeing south and now shielding against the winter cold in makeshift tents.\n\nThe head of the UN refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, urged an end to the suffering in the third month of the war.\n\n\"A humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is the only way forward,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"War defies logic and humanity, and prepares a future of more hatred and less peace.\"\n\nAnd World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus similarly renewed calls for a ceasefire, saying: \"The decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy.\"\n\nThe Jordanian army said its air force had air dropped aid to about 800 people sheltering at the Church of Saint Porphyrius in northern Gaza.\n\n- Heavy price -\n\nThe war was exacting a \"very heavy price\", Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday, as the death toll of soldiers killed in the conflict continued to mount.\n\n\"But we have no choice but to keep fighting,\" he said, adding: \"This will be a long war.\"\n\nAnother soldier was killed on Sunday, the army said, taking to 15 the number of troops killed since Friday and 154 since Israel's ground assault began on October 27.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus indicated that forces were close to gaining control in northern Gaza and that now \"we focus our efforts against Hamas in southern Gaza\".\n\nTwo freed detainees and a medic said Sunday that Palestinians held by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip had suffered torture, a charged denied by the military.\n\nThe two men were among hundreds detained by Israeli forces over alleged links with Hamas during Israel's ground offensive.\n\nAbout 20 men released from Israeli custody \"have bruises and marks of blows on their bodies\", Marwan al-Hams, hospital director in the southern city of Rafah, told AFP.",

    "articleBody": "Palestinian Delegation in Cairo for Talks on Israeli Offensive\n\nA delegation from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), an allied group with Hamas, has arrived in Cairo to discuss the ongoing Israeli offensive with Egyptian security officials. The talks are expected to address ways to end Israeli aggression and to halt new prisoner-swap deals with Israel until their military offensive in the Palestinian enclave concludes.\n\nDevastating Impact of the Conflict\n\nThe Israeli offensive has had a devastating impact on Gaza. Over the weekend, 14 Israeli soldiers were killed in combat, raising the death toll among Israeli troops to 153 since the offensive began. The war has ravaged parts of Gaza, claiming approximately 20,400 Palestinian lives and displacing nearly all of the territory\u2019s 2.3 million people. Over two-thirds of the Palestinian casualties have been women and children, leading to amplified international criticism of Israel\u2019s actions.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Mediation Role\n\nEgypt has a historical role in mediating conflicts involving Palestine and Israel. The current dialogue is seen as an extension of Egypt\u2019s continuous efforts to ease regional tensions. The talks in Cairo are expected to shape the future contours of the Middle East peace process and influence the dynamics of power in the region.\n\nIncreasing Violence and Hostilities\n\nThe conflict has led to increasing violence and threats against Jewish, Muslim, and Arab Americans. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has been escalating its military action, with Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi describing the attack in Khan Younis as impressive. Israel also bombed areas of Jabaliya in northern Gaza overnight, eliminating seven terrorists and destroying four Hamas survey methods.\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, the outcomes of the Cairo talks will be critical in defining the next steps towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nHadeel Hashem Hadeel Hashem is an internationally acclaimed journalist recognized for her profound dedication to climate change and environmental reporting.

Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrolled the empty square.\n\nThe gift shops were slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did once the rain had stopped pouring down. There were few visitors, however.\n\n\u201cThis year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there\u2019s just darkness,\u201d said Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years.\n\nHe said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, reminiscent of the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounded the scene, the grey rubble reflecting none of the joyous lights and bursts of color that normally fill the square during the Christmas season.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don\u2019t even have houses to go to,\u201d said Ala\u2019a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square.\n\nSalameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. \u201cNormally, you can\u2019t find a single chair to sit, we\u2019re full from morning till midnight,\u201d said Salameh. This year, just one table was taken, by journalists taking a break from the rain.\n\nSalameh said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and wasn\u2019t able to cover operating costs. He estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal.\n\nThe cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town\u2019s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem\u2019s income \u2014 almost all of that during the Christmas season.\n\nWith many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say over 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed.\n\nOver 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel\u2019s air and ground offensive against Gaza\u2019s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory\u2019s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas\u2019 deadly assault Oct. 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages.\n\nThe fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since Oct. 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel. (AP)",

A member of the group confirmed this development to Reuters on Sunday.\n\nFocus on the Palestinian Territories\n\nRumored to be led by Ziad Nakhaleh, the delegation\u2019s visit to Cairo signifies an effort to address critical issues, primarily concerning the political and security situation in the Palestinian territories.

    "articleBody": "Hyderabad: One of the most celebrated festivals across the globe, Christmas, is here. Observed annually on December 25, Christmas is a significant religious festival that has transcended its origins to become a global cultural and commercial phenomenon. Rooted in the Christian faith, it commemorates the birth of Jesus, a revered figure in Christianity, born to Joseph and Mary.\n\nHistory of Christmas-\n\nThe term \"Christmas\" originates in Old English, translating to \"Christ's Mass.\" Historically, the first documented Christmas celebration dates back to 336 during the reign of Roman Emperor Constantine, marking it as a longstanding tradition with a rich history.\n\nThe origins of Christmas intertwine with diverse cultural practices. Winter solstice, a time celebrated worldwide, predated the Christian era. Early Europeans, even before Jesus, found solace in the symbolism of light and birth during the darkest winter days. In Scandinavia, the Norse celebrated Yule around the winter solstice, while the Romans observed Saturnalia, a period of feasting and revelry, starting on December 17th.\n\nMedieval festivities spanned twelve days, culminating in 'Twelfth Night' on January 6th, when presents were exchanged. Tudor Christmases added a touch of regality, with a bean determining a 'King' on Twelfth Night.\n\nThe Victorian era witnessed the evolution of Christmas into a more family-oriented festival. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert played pivotal roles in shaping the holiday, popularizing Christmas trees and emphasizing family-focused celebrations.\n\nIn the early Christian era, Easter held precedence over Jesus' birth. The decision to establish Christmas as a holiday occurred in the fourth century, despite the Bible's silence on the exact birth date. Pope Julius I selected December 25, a date believed to coincide with the pagan Saturnalia festival, aiding in the assimilation of traditions.\n\nAncient Christian legend links Jesus' conception to the Annunciation on March 25, aligning with December 25 as the day of his birth. While historical evidence suggests a spring birth, the church's choice of December 25 has endured, marking the culmination of a complex interweaving of traditions and beliefs.\n\nUltimately, Christmas has evolved over millennia, encompassing a tapestry of customs, both spiritual and secular, contributing to its universal appeal and enduring significance.\n\nWho is Santa Claus?\n\nSanta Claus\n\nSanta Claus, rooted in the benevolent St. Nicholas, emerged as a figure of generosity and protection. St. Nicholas was born in Turkey around AD 280. He was a bishop in the early Christian church who was persecuted and imprisoned for his beliefs. He gave away all of his inherited wealth and roamed the countryside, assisting the impoverished and sick, earning the title of \"Protector of Children and Sailors.\"\n\nIn his honour, December 6 was designated as St. Nicholas Day. As time passed, each European society developed its version of St. Nicholas. Christkind or Kris Kringle (Christ child) accompanied St. Nicholas to bring presents to well-behaved youngsters in Swiss and German cultures. Jultomten was a cheerful elf who delivered gifts in Sweden by sleigh carried by goats. Then there was Father Christmas in England and Pere Noel in France.\n\nChristmas Tree-\n\nChristmas Tree\n\nThe Christmas tree tradition, linked to ancient beliefs in evergreens warding off evil, flourished in Germany around 400 years ago. The Feast of Adam and Eve was celebrated on December 24 during the Middle Ages, complete with a Paradise Tree, a fir tree draped with red apples.\n\nThe color green represents hope for prosperity and the arrival of spring. Among these Christmas decorations, the evergreen Fir trees maintain a special place because they were thought to have special abilities. During the celebration of Saturnalia, the Romans adopted this tradition, decorating their homes with ornamented Fir trees. The Greeks appeared to have a similar tradition, decorating trees in honour of their gods. It's a story that weaves together different civilisations via common holiday traditions.\n\nChristmas celebrations-\n\nChristmas celebrations encompass various customs worldwide. From attending church services and exchanging gifts to decorating homes and feasting, the holiday unites people in shared joy. The Christmas wreath, symbolising honour and victory, adds a festive touch.\n\nAround the globe, Christmas takes on diverse forms. In Bethlehem, Israel, celebrations occur three times, aligning with different Christian denominations. Australia and the United States share similar traditions, with Australia's unique touch of a warm, sunny Christmas. Romania emphasizes carols, while France kicks off celebrations with St. Nicholas Day.\n\nIn Russia, Christmas is a winter festival following a 39-day fast, while China and Japan incorporate their unique cultural elements into celebrations. Greece, following the Julian calendar, celebrates on January 7. Egyptian Christians observe a 43-day fast, concluding with festive gatherings.\n\nChristmas Day is marked by prayers expressing gratitude and seeking blessings. Wishes for a \"Merry Christmas\" are verbal embraces, spreading joy and positive sentiments. These traditions continue to evolve, adapting to changing times and circumstances.\n\nChristmas 2023-\n\nAs we step into Christmas 2023, notable shifts are observed. Bethlehem faces subdued festivities due to the Gaza conflict, highlighting the impact of geopolitical events on traditional celebrations.\n\nIn Ukraine, a historic shift from the Julian calendar to December 25 signifies a departure from Russian influence amid geopolitical tensions. Most Ukrainians are Orthodox Christians and the country's main church agreed this year's Christmas Celebration on December 25 to move away from the traditional Julian calendar, which is used in Russia and celebrates the holiday on January 7. This is another step towards erasing all traces of Russian influence as their military fends off a Kremlin invasion.",

    "articleBody": "External affairs minister S Jaishankar\u2019s five-day visit to Russia starting on December 25 is expected to focus on economic engagements and bilateral, multilateral and international issues. Jaishankar is travelling to Russia when the global geopolitics is getting more complex with each day.\n\nWhile the Russia-Ukraine war has been the major challenge for the world for the past almost two years, India has been exemplary in its diplomatic approach. Despite enjoying close ties with the West, India refused to toe the former\u2019s line. Instead India maintained a fine balance in its ties with the West and Russia. India\u2019s ties with the western countries remained cordial and even strengthened during this period. India also managed its ties with Russia well by purchasing Russian oil to the extent that now Russia is among India\u2019s top oil suppliers.\n\nHowever, the Israel-Hamas war and the response to it by the Houthis by continuously attacking ships passing through the Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb has thrown the entire arc of the Western Indian Ocean into a major security crisis. This offensive by the Houthis have also presented a fresh set of diplomatic and strategic challenges for the India-Russia relations.\n\nHouthis\u2019 attacks on the ships in the Red Sea and in particular in the crucial choke point of Bab el-Mandeb have disrupted the flow of global trade. Red Sea connects Indian Ocean to the Suez Canal through Bab el-Mandeb. Suez Canal accounts for about 12% of the global trade flow and about 30% of the global container transportation.\n\nHowever, for India, as also for Russia, the current security situation casts shadow on their engagements with the Middle Eastern region as well as with other extra-regional powers.\n\nThe Houthi aggression in the Red Sea has created a challenge for India\u2019s outreach to the region. The current upheaval is not likely to change India\u2019s engagements with the Gulf Arab States but would certainly affect India\u2019s physical outreach to the region. India\u2019s growing diplomatic investment in the region has been backed by participation in the plurilateral initiatives such as the I2U2 (India, Israel, United States and the UAE), India, Saudi Arabia, United States and the UAE and the recently launched IMEC (India-Middle East-Europe-Economic Corridor). Inter-regional connectivity to boost trade ties has been one of the main factors behind these initiatives. Also India\u2019s recent outreach towards the Gulf countries in the form of connectivity initiatives has a strong connection with the West. As these initiatives stand disrupted at least for some time, India\u2019s ties with Russia could witness a reset.\n\nAs regards to the Middle Eastern politics, particularly with respect to engagement with Iran, India and Russia stand at the opposite ends of spectrum. While enjoying close cooperation in the areas of defence and oil trade, India and Russia diverge in their interactions with Iran. Iran remains a close partner of Russia as the two countries face increasing hostility from the western countries. For its part, India\u2019s ties with the United States have always cast a shadow on its ties with former\u2019s ties with Iran.\n\nRussia\u2019s proximity to Iran combined with the Iran-backed Houthis threatening the stability of the Indian Ocean Region could spell a challenging time ahead for the India-Russia relations. These divergences between India and Russia could further be magnified in the larger context of the geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific Region.\n\nWhile not recognizing the geostrategic construct of the Indo-Pacific, Russia a resident power of the Pacific Ocean, has considerable presence in the Indian Ocean. In recent times Russia has been increasing its outreach to the region.\n\nRussia has arrangements with Eritrea, Egypt and Mozambique to access their ports. Russian naval ships have also been making port calls to these countries since 2016. In 2020, Russia signed an agreement with Sudan for setting-up a military-level facility at Port Sudan thereby adding to its access to the Indian Ocean. Russia has also been holding maritime drills in the Western Indian Ocean along with Iran and China.\n\nFurther, in November this year, Russia held a naval exercise with Myanmar in the Andaman Sea. Moscow termed this exercise as the first Russian-Myanmar naval exercise in modern history in which two Russian anti-submarine ships, Admiral Tributs and Admiral Panteleyev, participated along with a frigate and a corvette from Myanmar\u2019s Navy. A few days later, these same Russian ships docked at Bangladesh\u2019s Chittagong Port.\n\nDespite having divergent views on the Indo-Pacific Region, India and Russia have managed to work around them and cooperate in the maritime domain. India and Russia conduct a biennial joint naval exercise named Indra. The two countries are also engaged in development of Vladivostok-Chennai Corridor that would connect Russia\u2019s far-eastern city with one of India\u2019s major ports.\n\nFor India which is a major power in the Indian Ocean, the Indo-Pacific Region has been one of the key elements in strengthening its ties with the West, in particular the United States. India\u2019s navigation in the Indo-Pacific Region along with its western partners is essentially aimed at counterbalancing China\u2019s military and economic assertion in the region.\n\nRussia\u2019s presence in the Indo-Pacific Region, at least from India\u2019s perspective, was not as pronounced as China\u2019s. But now with faultlines in the Middle East and the Western Indian Ocean widening, Russia\u2019s role is likely to gain more traction and would be under greater scanner. With the United States announcing a coalition of 10 nations to counter Houthis, the strategic space in the Indian Ocean would be more contested in the coming days.\n\nIndia and Russia are expected to focus on economic area which has not been a major factor in their bilateral ties. At a time when insecurity in the Red Sea is disrupting a significant portion of the global trade the growth of business ties between India and Russia could be challenging since both the countries have diplomatic and strategic divergences in the region. India and Russia would have to invest considerable diplomatic efforts to maintain the cordial level of ties that the two have managed until now even in the face of geopolitical churn.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Email Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own.",

    "articleBody": "A lookback at 2023 will show it to be the year when hope was restored.\n\nIndia climbed out from a series of economic disasters: pandemic lockdowns, the impact of the Ukraine war, inflation, and steep interest rate hikes. The stock market galloped to all-time highs, and everyone\u2014from institutional investors to individuals\u2014joined the equity rally.\n\nEven the normally conservative Reserve Bank of India raised its FY2023-24 growth estimate to 7%.\n\nOne good year does not imply sustained growth, of course. But there were several growth-positive developments in 2023 that could give the economy some cheer going into the new year.\n\n1. Twin-engine economy\n\nThe Indian economy is primarily driven by domestic consumption. In FY2022-23, private consumption and fixed investment accounted for 61% and 31% of GDP, respectively.\n\nThis is both a strength and a weakness. The strong contribution of consumption cushions India from global slowdowns, but a low investment rate limits growth, and keeps India in the mindset that a 6% growth rate is the ceiling.\n\nIn the past, emerging economies have achieved high growth by being export-oriented (e.g., Thailand and Singapore) or investment-oriented (China), or both.\n\nThe good news? The push towards higher capital expenditure in the previous two Union budgets has brought investment, too, back into focus. So far, the government has taken the lead on investing. But RBI surveys show that the envisaged capex of private corporations increased in FY2021-22 and FY2022-23. The general belief is that businesses are keen to invest, but are waiting for the general election in 2024 to be over.\n\n2. Oil relief\n\nOil prices fell in the final quarter of 2023 despite the Israel-Hamas war and output cuts by oil producers. The price of the Indian basket of crude oil dropped from $93.5 per barrel in September to $77.6/bbl in December. Lower oil prices offer a welcome respite, because high prices push up inflation, worsen the trade deficit, and weaken the rupee. The relief may extend into 2024, as market conditions indicate that oil demand will stay weak amid adequate supply.\n\nSlower growth is forecast in Europe as its economies deal with high interest rates. The other large oil consumer, China, seems to be in a structural growth slump. Greater adoption of electric vehicles is also expected to drag down oil demand.\n\nOn the supply side, booming US production, supported by record volumes from Iran and Brazil, have more-or-less cancelled the impact of the production cuts and reduced Russian supplies. This augurs well for oil importers like India.\n\n3. Credit positive\n\nThe gap between India\u2019s credit-to-GDP ratio and its underlying trend\u2014called the \u201ccredit-to-GDP gap\"\u2014turned positive in June for the first time in a decade. This reflects improved credit demand.\n\nOther indicators also suggest that the credit cycle may be turning. Bank credit grew at double-digit rates through 2023, capacity utilization of manufacturing companies is higher than the long-term average, and asset quality has improved across all sectors.\n\nThe last credit surge in 2004\u20132008 ended badly because imprudent lending by banks and overleveraging by corporates led to a surge in bad loans. This time, regulatory oversight is sharper and quicker: note how RBI intervened to impose curbs on unsecured lending before it could pose systemic risk issues.\n\nThe banking sector is in a good place, and looks poised to achieve a credit boom supported by judicious lending, strong borrower balance sheets, and low non-performing assets.\n\n4. Geopolitical advantage\n\nThe China-plus-one strategy is expected to yield long-term benefits as companies de-risk by shifting some production out of China. But India saw some early payoffs in 2023. Notable examples include Foxconn, whose $2-billion additional investment was approved; Amazon, which plans to invest $26 billion by 2030; and Google, which announced local manufacturing of its Pixel smartphone.\n\nIndia has certain advantages among countries vying for a slice of the China-plus-one pie. Its market size makes it ideal for catering to domestic as well as export markets. It has the required workforce to supply local labour for large facilities. To put that into perspective, India\u2019s labour force is smaller than that of China, but 10 times the size of Vietnam and Mexico. Foxconn had 1 million workers in China; but only 50,000 in India as of June. In other words, this geopolitical shift could open up a large number of jobs for India.\n\n5. Market sentiment\n\nIndia\u2019s booming stock market is the biggest story of December. It is not just about the Sensex crossing the 70,000 mark or India surpassing Hong Kong in the list of the world\u2019s biggest stock markets. The sentiment underlying the bullishness is optimism about India\u2019s growth potential. Markets are betting that India\u2019s corporations, institutions and policymakers will deliver this time.\n\nThe signalling effect of a bull market is useful and necessary. As interest rates normalize and investment picks up, a bullish capital market will allow corporations to raise funds cheaply.\n\nIn the last quarter of 2023, leading brokerages including Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Nomura Securities upgraded India to \u2018overweight\u2019, underscoring their expectation of further value generation in Indian markets.\n\nForeign portfolio investors are already making a shift: more than $9.2 billion have poured in during the last two months (till 15 December).\n\nThe author is an independent writer in economics and finance.",

    "articleBody": "Year in review: Looking back on the best international movies of 2023\n\nDUBAI: Box-office blockbusters, masterful animation and low-key masterpieces, we round up the year\u2019s finest films.\n\n\u2018Oppenheimer\u2019\n\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\n\nStarring: Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr.\n\nWhen we look back on 2023, this will mark the year that one era of cinema ended, and another began. One after another, audiences are shunning the mindless blockbusters. The executive formulas have stopped working. And a new generation, hungry for genuine substance, have latched on to an unlikely blockbuster, a historical biopic of a scientist sung to the tune of a pulse-pounding political thriller. While Nolan\u2019s hypnotic style may be what brought the masses in, it\u2019s the multitudes the film contains that has kept them enamored even after the initial spell wore off. No film has put more of the best and worst of the human condition under its microscope this year than \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d and few ever have. And if this spawns a new generation of imitators trying to match this feat, we\u2019ll be all the better for it.\n\n\u2018Monster\u2019\n\nDirector: Hirokazu Kore-eda\n\nStarring: Sakura Ando, Eita Nagayama, Soya Kurokawa\n\nSome have compared the latest masterpiece of renowned Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda (\u201cShoplifters,\u201d \u201cAfterlife\u201d) to Akira Kurasawa\u2019s legendary 1950 film \u201cRashomon,\u201d which shows the same event from multiple perspectives in order to explore the different ways we can each remember the same event. But that comparison misses the mark. Rather, this extraordinary mystery, which follows a mother, her son, and the boy\u2019s teacher, is about the way our limited perspectives cause us to cast judgment on others when we cannot possibly know what those people are going through. It is something of a slow burn, but builds into one of the most powerful films in recent memory. A supreme work of empathy from a master of depicting life as it is lived.\n\n\u2018Anatomy of a Fall\u2019\n\nDirector: Justine Triet\n\nStarring: Sandra H\u00fcller, Swann Arlaud, Milo Machado Graner\n\nFilmmaker Justine Triet\u2019s Cannes Palme d\u2019Or winner, co-written by Egyptian-French writer Arthur Harari, is the best whodunnit of the decade, but would be better classified as a \u2018did-she-do-it?\u2019 It follows an author named Sandra who gets in an argument with her husband, only for her husband to be found dead in their driveway not long after. An investigation ensues that quickly turns the film into a captivating courtroom thriller, with performances so good and characters so layered and nuanced that you\u2019ll be changing your mind on what you actually think happened with nearly every scene. So many films have felt adolescent and half-baked in recent years \u2014 here is something that feels genuinely mature, in every way.\n\n\u2018The Holdovers\u2019\n\nDirector: Alexander Payne\n\nStarring: Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph\n\nAlexander Payne, the director behind the acclaimed films \u201cSideways,\u201d \u201cAbout Schmidt,\u201d and \u201cElection,\u201d has always felt strongly influenced by the off-beat, humanist films of the \u2018New Hollywood\u2019 movement of the 1970s. It makes sense, then, that in order to recapture his mojo after the disastrous last decade (his Wikipedia even has an entire \u201cCareer Slump\u201d section) he would make what feels like a lost Hal Ashby movie \u2014 a hilarious and heartfelt film about a teacher no one likes and a student no one can stand trapped together over their school\u2019s winter holidays. And because its characters are so well-drawn and the writing is so restrained, it somehow avoids becoming saccharine, which only deepens the emotions with each rewatch, which will surely become a yearly tradition for many.\n\n\u2018The Boy and the Heron\u2019\n\nDirector: Hayao Miyazaki\n\nVoice cast: Soma Santoki, Masaki Suda, Aimyon\n\nMaster filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki \u2014 the sorcerer supreme of Japanese animation \u2014 was supposed to be retired. His last film, \u201cThe Wind Rises,\u201d came out in 2013, and was deemed at the time to be the perfect send off. But the 82-year-old has returned with an even better one; perhaps the greatest achievement of his storied career. Fittingly, it feels like a sister film to his 2001 masterpiece \u201cSpirited Away,\u201d this time following a young boy whose story closely resembles his own real-life origins. The boy moves to his family\u2019s country house to escape the horrors of World War II, only to find himself transported to another world in his backyard. Describing the plot, of course, does little to capture the film, which finds Miyazaki wrestling with the same themes that have defined much of his work, and coming to powerful conclusions.\n\n\u2018Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nStarring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, Robert De Niro\n\nLike Hayao Miyazaki, Martin Scorsese is now an octogenarian doing some of the best work of his career, delving ever deeper into the themes that have defined it. \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d though, differs from his past work in a number of fascinating ways. For one, the film is constantly wrestling with what it means to be documenting the story of this real-life tragedy at all, doing its best to honor the victims from the indigenous-American Osage Nation by refusing to glamourize their murders. There are no thrills here, only matter-of-fact horror, and sometimes a grim sense of humor mined in the banal evil of its hapless leads. In the film\u2019s most powerful scene, Scorsese indicts all those that have exploited the deaths of these people \u2014 even himself. I won\u2019t tell you how, as it\u2019s one of the best moments in modern film.\n\n\u2018Beau is Afraid\u2019\n\nDirector: Ari Aster\n\nStarring: Joaquin Phoenix, Patti Lupone, Parker Posey\n\nThe latest from the troubled mind that brought the world both \u201cHereditary\u201d and \u201cMidsommar\u201d feels at times like you\u2019re watching another Ari Aster horror movie. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re watching it for, though, you\u2019ll be disappointed \u2014 which perhaps explains the initial mixed reaction to the movie. Instead, watch this as a pure comedy, one that follows a hapless man paralyzed by his own indecision, whose passivity leads to grander and grander horrors beyond his comprehension. Phoenix may be one of our finest dramatic actors, but with both \u201cBeau is Afraid\u201d and another misunderstood 2023 film, Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon,\u201d he\u2019s proven to be an even better comedy actor, harnessing humanity at its most pathetic somehow without cruelty.\n\n\u2018Showing Up\u2019\n\nDirector: Kelly Reichardt\n\nStarring: Michelle Williams, Hong Chau, Andr\u00e9 3000\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss \u201cShowing Up,\u201d the latest from one of the best living directors, Kelly Reichardt (\u201cMeek\u2019s Cutoff,\u201d \u201cFirst Cow\u201d). It is, after all, very small. Most of it takes place in the tiny home studio of a sculptor as she readies her latest work for a gallery showing. The biggest conflict of the film follows the aftermath of her cat attacking a pigeon, whose survival she then becomes unexpectedly invested in. Still, by its end, after we\u2019ve witnessed another masterful turn from another of the best actors working today \u2014 Michelle Williams. This character portrait ends up surprisingly moving, and lingers long after you\u2019d expect it to fade. A tiny triumph.",

    "articleBody": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nAfter months of negotiations, British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe (chairman and CEO of chemical company INEOS) has finally completed a deal to acquire a 25% stake in Manchester United for around \u00a31.25 billion ($1.6bn).\n\nSources told ESPN's Rob Dawson that the deal will give Ratcliffe some influence over the football side of the business, with Sir Dave Brailsford, director of sport at INEOS, expected to be heavily involved. But United's unpopular American owners, the Glazer family, will keep their majority shareholding after they rejected bids for a full takeover worth around \u00a35bn from both Ratcliffe and Qatari businessman Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani.\n\nSources added that Ratcliffe is ready to invest funds to improve both the Old Trafford stadium and Carrington training ground, but what should the focus be now the paperwork has been signed?\n\nIn a 25-year career, ESPN's Tor-Kristian Karlsen has worked at a number of clubs in a variety of countries including England, Germany, Russia, France, Israel and Norway -- in roles such as chief executive, sporting director, chief scout -- and is well qualified to answer that question. So here's his to-do list for Ratcliffe and the United hierarchy.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\nMake structural changes\n\nThe most obvious place to start an overhaul of a club is at the top. With the club's CEO Richard Arnold leaving and lawyer Patrick Stewart taking control in the interim, United have already begun the search for a permanent replacement. More crucially, a sporting director is required. Though United already employ a football director (John Murtough) and technical director (Darren Fletcher), it's debatable how much faith the club really have in these roles given the power that manager Erik ten Hag exerts in the transfer market and the scarce media presence of both Murtough and Fletcher. Indeed, the positions seem not to be given the same mandates as at other comparable clubs across Europe.\n\nWhile United went to great lengths to explain the roles upon their hiring in March 2021, it doesn't fit with the continental-style sporting director who reports directly to the CEO, the board or the owner. For the sporting director role to work, they should be positioned between the board (CEO) and the head coach with a strong enough mandate to take proper charge of footballing strategy.\n\nOne challenge in hiring the right sporting director is that there are few viable candidates with the experience of driving a project of this magnitude. Candidates with a good track record in the transfer market are typically scrutinised (and often promoted by the media), yet other skills beyond scouting and recruitment -- such as leadership qualities, dealing with pressure, media skills, and personality -- are arguably as crucial at a club like United. These, though, are often harder to analyse from outside, which can make for an intricate and lengthy search process.\n\nWhat seems clear in United's case, however, is that personal skills and strategic thinking are a prerequisite. With an experienced head of recruitment left to the transfer side of things (the current chief scout is Steve Brown) the sporting director could focus on running the vast sporting operation, from academy to the first team, and provide Ten Hag with much-needed support when it comes to representing the club in the media.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe and his company will have some influence over the football side of the business now the investment deal is complete. Photo by Peter Byrne/PA Images via Getty Images\n\nFocus on the future, not the past\n\nOnce the right person is found, the first remit for a sporting director is taking on a strategic review of the entire sporting and medical set-up. United lack a clear, shared vision and, when it comes to playing style, seem to rely on sporadic mentions of \"The United Way\" -- which, apart from alluding to whatever brought success during the Sir Alex Ferguson era, has never been properly defined. It's no wonder that it has been hard-to-see actual results on the pitch. United must create and implement a strategy that joins up the club in terms of playing style, coaching principles and method. Something that has proved to work well at immediate rivals such as Manchester City and Arsenal.\n\nTor-Kristian Karlsen is a Norwegian football scout and executive and is the former chief executive and sporting director at AS Monaco. He will write regularly for ESPN on the business of soccer and the process of scouting.\n\nWhile easier said than done -- and it will take years to see in full flow -- an overriding philosophy led by the sporting director, which aligns the thinking from youth players to first team, is essential for a top club.\n\nDesigning a \"United Way 2.0\" that is resolutely focused on the future is vital for a club that seems overly nostalgic and consumed by its own past. Though United's history and traditions are a huge part of its DNA and should be respected and celebrated, constant comparison and harking back can pile on unwanted pressure and even stifle vital dynamism and agility.\n\nUnited have been almost tethered to the idea of finding an all-encompassing manager in the style of Ferguson since 2013 -- David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho among the failures -- while the appointments of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Murtough and Fletcher are examples of a club that doesn't look far beyond its own ranks. The recruitment of staff who have experience outside of Manchester United is healthy and could certainly help to stimulate fresh thinking and ideas.\n\nplay 1:16 What will Ratcliffe's investment mean for Erik ten Hag? Rob Dawson says the pressure on Erik ten Hag's job will increase when Jim Ratcliffe gets his stake in Manchester United.\n\nKeep faith with Ten Hag and give players a clean slate\n\nCalls to sack coach Ten Hag have come amid some inconsistent form this season, but INEOS should resist any temptation to do so yet. Although the Dutchman might not be in a good place currently, the arrival of a new sporting director (and CEO) should relieve him of a plethora of unnecessary and irrelevant duties such as answering for transfer policy, general club strategy or negative stories around issues with players (i.e. Jadon Sancho.)\n\nLet others deal with the transfer market and problematic players, INEOS need to give Ten Hag support with media-related issues and leave him to dedicate his focus where he's best: on the training pitch.\n\nIn theory there's still no reason why Ten Hag couldn't turn out to be a successful coach at United and play a vital role in the new setup. In fact, his Ajax side were not far from what most top European clubs aspire to and, given the right support from upstairs and a reenergised organisation, he stands a better chance of rediscovering his principles and reproducing the results from earlier in his career. Besides, replacing a head coach in the middle of a season makes little sense. The top candidates are unlikely to be available, and any new arrival would struggle to make the desired impact amid significant organisational change.\n\nINEOS taking charge of sporting decisions is likely to cause some transitory turmoil, so keep any major changes on hold until the results of the strategic review are revealed -- most likely at the end of the season. With that in mind, INEOS should also insist that players are given a clean slate. Without undermining Ten Hag, an effort to heal any lingering conflicts should be left to the sporting director and CEO.\n\nAs much as the ongoing dispute with winger Jadon Sancho might be irreparable, it's nonetheless puzzling to see a first-team player who cost them \u20ac85 million from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 being ostracised. Decisions of such nature tend to be handled by senior club executives rather than the head coach, which in turn might prevent a total breakdown in the relationship between the player and the boss. While a suspension might be the right outcome in the end, this way of handling things leaves room for reconciliation if it is taken away from the person who picks the team.\n\nplay 1:54 Who could leave Man United in January after Champions League exit? Rob Dawson explains why Man United could look to offload some players in the January transfer window.\n\nRevamp the transfer strategy\n\nFirst, United need to stop overpaying for players in the transfer market. If their prime transfer targets prove too expensive, they should move on to the next option or trust the academy as they have with midfielder Kobbie Mainoo. United are as capable of maintaining a comprehensive, up-to-date short list as any other big club -- so why not turn to the next name down rather being drawn into months of negotiations where they never have the upper hand? The signings of Sancho (\u20ac85m from Dortmund) and Antony (\u20ac95m from Ajax) are telling examples of this failed approach. Sticking to their own limit of a player's transfer value will send out a clear signal that United will not be taken for a ride again.\n\nPart of this would include removing the head coach from leading the recruitment process. With several recent arrivals having an Ajax past (Christian Eriksen), a connection with the Netherlands (Tyrell Malacia) or having worked with Ten Hag previously (Antony, Sofyan Amrabat, Lisandro Mart\u00ednez, Andr\u00e9 Onana), it's fair to assume that he has had a strong influence in the signing of new players.\n\nWhile the head coach should always have a say when it comes to transfer moves, a competent sporting director and top scouting team have the deep knowledge and expertise to lead the search, which benefits everyone.\n\nAs a result, better planning means that \"emergency signings\" such as Amrabat, Sergio Reguil\u00f3n, Wout Weghorst and Odion Ighalo (to name some from recent history) would no longer happen. That type of stop-gap solution just devalues what it means to represent Manchester United. Sure, a pragmatic short-term signing might occasionally be needed, but as a principle United should turn to the academy and not to the transfer market when the media or fans scream out for new arrivals.\n\nFurthermore, United's policy of going for \"trophy signings\" such as Cristiano Ronaldo (in his return) or Real Madrid pair Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Casemiro might have pleased the supporters in the short term, but if it doesn't bring significant success then it makes the club appear reactive. Instead of bringing in recognised big-name players late in the transfer window, United's plan should be to emulate Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool (as well as Chelsea, without going to extremes) by identifying up-and-coming talent with a view to closing deals early.\n\nFinally, a bit of patience with regard to contract extensions would be good; United should not be afraid to lose a star player on a free transfer. Manchester City let club captain Ilkay G\u00fcndogan leave on a free last summer, while Liverpool refrained from offering new deals to Sadio Man\u00e9 and Roberto Firmino once they hit the age of 30. United could do well to adopt the same strategy. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but their main rivals seem to operate with less sentimentality when it comes to renewals (Phil Jones' four-year extension in 2019 being the most baffling given his injury history.)\n\nplay 2:10 What Man United can learn from Jim Ratcliffe's time at Nice Julien Laurens looks back on the good and bad of Jim Ratcliffe's time at Nice since taking over in 2019.\n\nStick to the plan and be patient\n\nWith the changes that come with a new sporting direction -- whether that's adopting a more expansive playing style, changing the structure within the club, or turnover in personnel -- consistent results are unlikely to come immediately. And yes, that means another dreaded period of transition may be what's needed.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp's first year at Liverpool was a struggle that ended in eighth place, and even Pep Guardiola faced criticism over his \"overambitious\" playing style during his first season at Man City as his defenders and goalkeeper struggled to cope with the extra ball-playing responsibility. But Guardiola stuck to what he knew and remained confident that his beliefs would bear fruit as the pressure mounted -- which they obviously did when he was able to recruit the right players.\n\nTen Hag could yet find success with the newfound energy that comes with INEOS' backing and a new sporting director. However, if it doesn't work out and there are few signs of improvement, the new regime will have ample time until the summer to review other candidates.\n\nWhile any club strategy needs some level of adjustment as it's put into practice, changing the script as a result of outside pressure is not going to get you anywhere. United have to learn that and ensure that we're not having the same conversation about them in another five years.",

MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.56% after touching its highest level since late March 2022. The global index has gained about 15% since late October. Meanwhile oil futures extended the previous session's gains after attacks by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi militants on ships in the Red Sea disrupted maritime trade and forced companies to reroute their vessels.\n\nThe yen lost ground after the Bank of Japan kept its ultra-low interest rates unchanged and made no change to its dovish policy guidance, dashing some traders' hopes it would signal a near-term end to negative interest rates. U.S. Treasury yields edged lower but held above multi-month lows reached last week as investors continued to monitor comments from Fed officials for indications on when the U.S. central bank is likely to begin cutting interest rates.\n\nTreasury yields have fallen since Fed chair Jerome Powell took an unexpectedly dovish tone on Wednesday. But the stock market has paid little attention even as several other speakers tried to dampen expectations of rate cuts. Atlanta Fed President\n\nRaphael Bostic said on Tuesday there is no \"urgency\" for rate cuts given the strength of the U.S. economy and the need to ensure inflation returns to the 2% target.\n\n\"Ever since Powell did a pivot people have been in a buying mood. Prior to Wednesday Powell had been a little negative, saying we're not even thinking about thinking about rate cuts,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer, Independent Advisor Alliance, Charlotte, North Carolina. \"The market heard what they wanted to hear from Powell and they're not really listening to what to rest of the Fed speakers are saying,\" he added.\n\nOn Wall Street\n\n, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 205.24 points, or 0.55%, to 37,511.26, the S&P 500 gained 22.36 points, or 0.47%, to 4,762.92 and the Nasdaq Composite added 76.45 points, or 0.51%, to 14,981.65. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.36%. European Central Bank member Francois Villeroy de Galhau said interest rates should be lowered in 2024 and that inflation should return to the ECB's 2% target by 2025 at the latest.\n\nAt the central bank's meeting last week, ECB President Christina Lagarde had pushed back against market bets on imminent rate cuts, but markets were not convinced. In U.S. Treasuries, benchmark 10-year notes were down 3.2 basis points to 3.924%, from 3.956% late on Monday. The 30-year bond was last down 3.4 basis points to yield 4.0345%. The 2-year note was last was down 1.1 basis points to yield 4.4457%, from 4.457%.\n\nIn currencies, while the U.S. dollar gained against the yen, it was broadly softer against other majors, weighed down by expectations for interest rate cuts next year. The yen weakened 0.79% versus the greenback at 143.89 per dollar while the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.312%.\n\nThe euro rose 0.46% to $1.0972 while Sterling was last trading at $1.2726, up 0.66% on the day. Oil prices rose as the United States announced creation of a task force to safeguard Red Sea commerce while Houthis vowed to defy the U.S.-led naval mission and keep hitting Israeli targets in the region.\n\nU.S. crude settled up 1.34% at $73.44 per barrel and Brent finished the session at $79.23, up 1.64%. In\n\nprecious metals , gold prices firmed as U.S. dollar and Treasury yields slipped, while investors strapped in for U.S. economic data due this week that could provide more clarity on the Fed's interest rate path.\n\nSpot gold added 0.6% to $2,039.20 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.81% to $2,038.40 an ounce.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

One man hugged a dead child and others were hysterical.\n\nBy Nidal al-Mughrabi, Bassam Masoud and Dan Williams CAIRO/GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) -At a funeral in Gaza on Monday a line of Palestinians touched white shrouds containing the bodies of at least 70 people who Palestinian health officials said were killed by an Israeli airstrike targeting Maghazi in the centre of the besieged strip.\n\nStrikes that began hours before midnight persisted into Monday. Palestinian media said Israel stepped up air and ground shelling in central Gaza with local residents saying they had lived one of their worst nights since the war began.\n\nHealth ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said many of those killed at Maghazi were women and children. Eight others were killed as Israeli planes and tanks carried out dozens of air strikes on houses and roads in nearby al-Bureij and al-Nusseirat, health officials said.\n\nMedics added that an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis in southern Gaza killed 23, bringing total Palestinian fatalities overnight to more than 100.\n\nPope Francis said in his Christmas message on Monday that children dying in wars, including in Gaza, are the \u201clittle Jesuses of today\u201d and that Israeli strikes were reaping an \u201cappalling harvest\u201d of innocent civilians.\n\nSeveral residents made pleas on social media for people to afford them shelter as they have become homeless after leaving their homes in Bureij.\n\n\u201cI have 60 people in the house, people who arrived at my house believing that central Gaza area was safe. Now we are searching for a place to get to,\u201d said Odeh, a resident of the refugee camps.\n\nThe Israeli army said it was reviewing the report of a Maghazi incident and was committed to minimising harm to civilians. Hamas denies the Israeli charge that it operates in densely populated areas or uses civilians as human shields.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent published footage of wounded residents being transported to hospitals. It said Israeli warplanes were bombing main roads, hindering the passage of ambulances and emergency vehicles.\n\nIn his Christmas Day \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d (to the city and world) address, Francis also called the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants \u201cabominable\u201d and again appealed for the release of around 100 hostages still being held in Gaza.\n\nClergy cancelled celebrations in Bethlehem, the Israeli-occupied Palestinian West Bank city where Christian tradition says Jesus was born in a stable 2,000 years ago.\n\nPalestinian Christians held a candle-lit Christmas vigil in Bethlehem with hymns and prayers for peace in Gaza, instead of the usual celebrations.\n\nThere was no large tree, the usual centrepiece of Bethlehem\u2019s Christmas observances. Nativity figurines in churches were placed amid rubble and barbed wire in solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nCATASTROPHIC CONDITIONS\n\nHamas and smaller militant ally Islamic Jihad, both sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction, are believed to be holding more than 100 hostages from among 240 they captured during their Oct. 7 rampage through Israeli towns, when they killed 1,200 people.\n\nSince then, Israel has besieged the narrow Gaza Strip and laid much of it to waste, with more than 20,400 people confirmed killed, according to authorities in Hamas-ruled Gaza, and thousands more believed dead under the rubble.\n\nThe vast majority of the 2.3 million Gazans have been driven from their homes, and the United Nations says conditions are catastrophic.\n\nSince a week-long truce collapsed at the start of the month, fighting has only intensified on the ground, with war spreading from the north to the full length of the densely populated strip.\n\nThe Israeli military said on Monday that two of its soldiers had died in the past day, bringing to 158 the number killed since ground operations began on Oct. 20.\n\nA day earlier Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had acknowledged the \u201cheavy cost\u201d but said there was \u201cno choice\u201d but to continue to fight deeper into Gaza until \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas.\n\nIsrael has been under pressure from its closest ally the United States to shift operations to a lower-intensity phase and reduce civilian deaths.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel\u2019s military chief of staff said his forces had largely achieved operational control in the north of Gaza and would expand operations further in the south.\n\nBut residents say fighting has only intensified in northern districts.\n\nDiplomatic efforts, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, on a new truce to free the remaining hostages held in Gaza have yielded little public progress, although Washington described the talks last week as \u201cvery serious\u201d.\n\nNetanyahu was due to attend a parliamentary discussion of the issue on Monday afternoon and then to convene a session of his war cabinet, Israeli officials told Reuters.\n\nIslamic Jihad said a delegation led by its exiled leader Ziad al-Nakhlala was in Cairo on Sunday. His arrival followed talks attended by Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in recent days.\n\nThe militant groups have said they would not discuss any release of hostages unless Israel ends its war in Gaza, while the Israelis say they are willing to discuss only a pause in fighting.\n\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza, Dan Williams in Jerusalem; Additional reporting by Philip Pullella in Rome, Nafisa Eltahir in Cairo and Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington; Writing by Humeyra Pamuk and William Mallard; Editing by Howard Goller and Edmund Klamann and Michael Georgy, Kirsten Donovan)\n\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.

The vast majority of the 2.3 million Gazans have been driven from their homes and the United Nations says conditions are catastrophic.\n\nAt noon (1100 GMT) on Monday, Mr. Francis will deliver his Christmas Day \"Urbi et Orbi\" (to the city and the world) message and blessing.",

In the study, researchers, led by PhD student Shani Agron from the institute\u2019s Brain Science Lab, set out to determine whether tears have the same aggression-blocking effect in people as they do in rodents.\n\nIn a series of experiments, men were exposed to either women\u2019s emotional tears or saline, without knowing what they were sniffing or being able to distinguish between the two.\n\nFollowing that, they played a two-player game designed to generate hostile behaviour in one player towards the other, who was portrayed as cheating.\n\nWhen given the opportunity, the men could get revenge on the perceived cheaters by causing them to lose money, though they themselves gained nothing.\n\nAfter sniffing women\u2019s emotional tears, the men\u2019s revenge seeking aggressive behaviour throughout the game decreased by 44 per cent, or roughly in half, the researchers noted.\n\nThe researchers mentioned that this result seemed equivalent to the effect observed in rodents, but rodents have a structure in their noses called the vomeronasal organ that picks up social chemical signals.\n\n\u201cThese findings suggest that tears are a chemical blanket offering protection against aggression \u2013 and that this effect is common to rodents and humans, and perhaps to other mammals as well,\u201d said Prof Noam Sobel, head of the Brain Sciences Department.\n\nAgron said: \u201cWe knew that sniffing tears lowers testosterone, and that lowering testosterone has a greater effect on aggression in men than in women, so we began by studying the impact of tears on men because this gave us higher chances of seeing an effect.\u201d",

    "articleBody": "December 25, 2023 03:40 am | Updated 07:45 am IST - DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza\n\nAt least 70 people were killed in Gaza in one of the deadliest strikes of the war, health officials said Sunday, while the number of Israeli soldiers killed in combat over the weekend rose to 15.\n\nAssociated Press journalists at a nearby hospital watched frantic Palestinians carry the dead, including a baby, and wounded following the strike on the Maghazi refugee camp east of Deir al-Balah. One bloodied young girl looked stunned while her body was checked for broken bones.\n\nGaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said the toll was likely to rise. The Israeli military had no immediate comment.\n\n\u201cWe were all targeted,\u201d said Ahmad Turokmani, who lost several family members including his daughter and grandson. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza anyway.\u201d\n\nAs Christmas Eve fell, smoke rose over the besieged territory, while in the West Bank Bethlehem was hushed, its holiday celebrations called off. In neighboring Egypt, tentative efforts continued on a deal for another exchange of hostages for Palestinians held by Israel.\n\nThe war has devastated parts of Gaza, killed roughly 20,400 Palestinians and displaced almost all of the territory\u2019s 2.3 million people.\n\nThe mounting death toll among Israeli troops \u2014 154 since the ground offensive began \u2014 could erode public support for the war, which was sparked when Hamas-led militants stormed communities in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 and taking 240 hostage.\n\nIsraelis still largely stand behind the country\u2019s stated goals of crushing Hamas\u2019 governing and military capabilities and releasing the remaining 129 captives. That\u2019s despite rising international pressure against Israel\u2019s offensive, and the soaring death toll and unprecedented suffering among Palestinians.\n\n\u201cThe war exacts a very heavy price from us, but we have no choice but to continue fighting,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.\n\nIn a nationally televised speech, Israeli President Isaac Herzog appealed for the country to remain united. \u201cThis moment is a test. We will not break nor blink,\u201d he said.\n\nThere has been widespread anger against his government, which many criticize for failing to protect civilians on Oct. 7 and promoting policies that allowed Hamas to gain strength over the years. Netanyahu has avoided accepting responsibility for the military and policy failures.\n\n\u201cOver time, the public will find it hard to ignore the heavy price paid, as well as the suspicion that the aims that were loudly heralded are still far from being attained, and that Hamas is showing no signs of capitulating in the near future,\u201d wrote Amos Harel, military affairs commentator for the Haaretz newspaper.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had completed the dismantling of Hamas\u2019 underground headquarters in northern Gaza, part of an operation to take down the vast tunnel network and kill off top commanders that Israeli leaders have said could take months.\n\nEfforts toward negotiations continued. The head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, arrived in Egypt for talks. The militant group, which also took part in the Oct. 7 attack, said it was prepared to consider releasing hostages only after fighting ends. Hamas\u2019 top leader Ismail Haniyeh traveled to Cairo for talks days earlier.\n\nIsrael\u2019s offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than two-thirds of the 20,000 Palestinians killed have been women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said a 13-year-old boy was shot and killed in an Israeli drone attack while inside al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, a part of Gaza where Israel\u2019s military believes Hamas leaders are hiding.\n\nAn Israeli strike overnight hit a house in a refugee camp west of the city of Rafah, on Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt. At least two men were killed, according to Associated Press journalists in the hospital where the bodies were taken.\n\nAt least two people were killed and six others wounded when a missile stuck a building in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.\n\nAnd Palestinians reported heavy Israeli bombardment and gunfire in Jabaliya, an area north of Gaza City that Israel had claimed to control. Hamas\u2019 military arm said its fighters shelled Israeli troops in Jabaliya and Jabaliya refugee camp.\n\nIsrael faces international criticism for the civilian death toll but it blames Hamas, citing the militants\u2019 use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel has launched thousands of airstrikes since Oct. 7. It says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, without presenting evidence.\n\nIsrael also faces allegations of mistreating Palestinian men and teenage boys detained in homes, shelters, hospitals and elsewhere during the offensive. It has denied abuse allegations and said those without links to militants are quickly released.\n\nSpeaking to the AP from a hospital bed in Rafah after his release, Khamis al-Burdainy of Gaza City said Israeli forces detained him after tanks and bulldozers partly destroyed his home. He said men were handcuffed and blindfolded.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep. We didn\u2019t get food and water,\u201d he said, crying and covering his face.\n\nAnother released detainee, Mohammed Salem, from the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, said Israeli troops beat them. \u201cWe were humiliated,\u201d he said. \u201cA female soldier would come and beat an old man, aged 72 years old.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has passed a watered-down resolution calling for the speedy delivery of humanitarian aid for hungry and desperate Palestinians and the release of all the hostages, but not for a cease-fire.\n\nBut it was not immediately clear how and when deliveries of food, medical supplies and other aid, far below the daily average of 500 before the war, would accelerate. Trucks enter through two crossings: Rafah, and Kerem Shalom on the border with Israel. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, said 123 aid trucks entered Gaza on Sunday,\n\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated U.N. calls for a humanitarian cease-fire, adding on social media that \u201cthe decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy.\u201d\n\nAmid concerns about a wider regional conflict, the U.S. Central Command said a patrol ship in the Red Sea on Saturday shot down four drones launched from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, a while two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into international shipping lanes.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthis say their attacks are aimed at Israel-linked ships in an effort to stop the Israeli offensive in Gaza.",

    "articleBody": "Christmas is celebrated in many ways in many corners of the globe, and the cuisine that marks the holiday is as diverse as the people feasting on it.\n\nChristmas and Advent food traditions are comforting at a time when many people have had a challenging year. And Christmas dishes are particularly special in many households.\n\nThe typical Christmas meal may be different by destination, but the idea of indulging in a feast, be it on the day itself or the night before, isn\u2019t.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how locals celebrate Christmas through cuisine in seven countries. We asked hospitality experts about these traditions, and they shared their perspective on what\u2019s typical for them as well as their families and friends.\n\nIn France, a b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl makes for a sweet end to a lavish holiday meal. - Shutterstock\n\nFrance\n\nThe French enjoy their lavish holiday meal on December 24, says Francois Payard, the renowned pastry chef who grew up in Nice.\n\nLocals sit down for dinner around 8 p.m., he says, and savor a first course of seafood. That usually means a lobster thermidor \u2013 a baked dish of the cooked crustacean mixed with mustard, egg yolks and brandy \u2013 or a shrimp scampi.\n\nThen it\u2019s on to a large capon \u2013 a male chicken that\u2019s renowned for its tenderness \u2013 and a medley of sides including mashed potatoes and chestnuts sauteed with butter and topped with sage. \u201cChestnuts are a fixture in any Christmas meal for us,\u201d says Payard.\n\nDessert, the grand finale, is a yule log, or b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl \u2013 the French version of a Christmas cake. Often two are served \u2013 one chocolate, the other chestnut. To drink, it\u2019s the finest wine you can get your hands on, usually red from Burgundy that\u2019s not too full-bodied for the capon.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the French savor a hearty brunch that may include creamy scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and toast. The meal finishes with assorted cheeses such as Brie, Gruyere and Munster, Payard says.\n\nTortellini in brodo is part of many an Italian Christmas Eve spread. - Shutterstock\n\nItaly\n\nSimilar to France, Italians celebrate Christmas with their biggest spread on the eve of the big day. Luca Finardi, the general manager of the Mandarin Oriental Milan, says that locals usually attend midnight Mass and enjoy a sumptuous meal before heading to church.\n\nSmoked salmon with buttered crostini or a smoked salted cod is the precursor to the main meal. Italians from coastal areas such as the Amalfi Coast may start with a crudo such as sea bass with herbs and sea salt, says Finardi.\n\nNext up is tortellini in brodo \u2013 stuffed pasta bathed in a hot broth of chicken and Parmesan cheese \u2013 the latter of which must come from the namesake region in Italy.\n\nFor the main meal, northern Italians tend to have stuffed turkey while those from seaside areas may tuck into a large baked sea bass surrounded by roasted potatoes and vegetables.\n\n\u201cThe must no matter where you\u2019re from is panettone \u2013 a typical sweet bread,\u201d says Finardi. \u201cThe secret is to warm it up for just a few minutes.\u201d Spumante, a sparkling wine, is the drink of choice.\n\nAs for the famous Italian Christmas meal of the feast of the seven fishes, Finardi says it\u2019s limited mainly to the Campania region, which includes the Amalfi Coast and Naples.\n\nChristmas Day is more about connecting with family and less about food, Finardi says. \u201cWe eat leftovers and recover from the day before.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nChristmas pudding, sometimes flaming with brandy, finishes the traditional English Christmas feast. - Shutterstock\n\nEngland\n\nThe Brits don\u2019t typically indulge in their big holiday meal on Christmas Eve. \u201cThe 24th is for cooking with our families and going to the local pub for a pint,\u201d says Nicola Butler, the owner of the London-based luxury travel company NoteWorthy.\n\nThe real festivities start on Christmas morning with a glass of champagne and a breakfast of smoked salmon and mince pieces, she says. Later that day, after the Queen\u2019s annual Christmas speech is aired, it\u2019s time for dinner.\n\nThat means a turkey or roast beef and a host of sides such as roasted parsnips and carrots, buttered peas and Brussels sprouts. Some families include Yorkshire pudding, a savory baked good of flour, eggs and milk made with meat drippings.\n\nDessert is Christmas pudding, which is actually a dark and dense cake made with dried fruits, spices and usually a splash of brandy. \u201cWe have lots of wine to go along with the food,\u201d says Butler.\n\nChristmas honey cookies are part of a typical Greek holiday spread. - Shutterstock\n\nGreece\n\nMaria Loi, the celebrity Greek chef, says that the country\u2019s holiday celebrations begin on Christmas Eve around 7 p.m.\n\n\u201cFamilies sit around the fireplace and eat a special wheat bread that we make only at Christmas,\u201d she says. \u201cSome households also eat pork sausages. It\u2019s the only [occasion] Greeks eat pork because the meat is not common in our cuisine.\u201d\n\nAfter attending an early morning holy communion on Christmas Day, Greeks go home for an all-day eating fest, says Loi.\n\nHomemade honey cookies with walnuts or almonds come first followed by chicken soup with orzo. A few hours later, it\u2019s on to either a roast chicken stuffed with chestnuts or variations of grilled or braised pork dishes. Sides such as sauteed wild greens, finely shredded romaine with scallions and feta cheese and roasted lemon potatoes accompany the entr\u00e9e.\n\nDessert is light and could be baked apples with honey and walnuts or Greek yogurt topped with honey. To drink, Loi says Greeks favor red wine.\n\nPosole is a traditional way to start a Mexican Christmas meal. - Shutterstock\n\nMexico\n\nMexicans get the Christmas festivities going on December 24, according to Pablo Carmona and Josh Kremer, co-founders of Paradero Hotels.\n\n\u201cFamilies start by breaking a pi\u00f1ata that\u2019s filled with all sorts of locally made candies in chili and tamarind flavors,\u201d says Kremer. Dinner follows usually somewhere between 7 and 10 p.m.\n\nThe meal starts with posole \u2013 a stew with big corn kernels and pork or beef that\u2019s accompanied by as many as 20 condiments such as parsley, cilantro, chiles and assorted cheeses.\n\nIn a nod to the American influence in Mexico, the entr\u00e9e \u2013 at least for Carmona and Kremer \u2013 is a turkey with all the trimmings such as mashed potatoes and green beans.\n\nThe sweet finish is often a creamy flan plus strawberries and cream. But the meal isn\u2019t complete without tequilas and mezcals to go along with the food.\n\nOn the 25th, many Mexicans heat up the leftovers from the night before. \u201cWe\u2019re tired so we don\u2019t want to bother to cook,\u201d says Carmona.\n\nHomemade tamales are a staple in Costa Rica. - Shutterstock\n\nCosta Rica\n\nMany Costa Ricans celebrate Christmas with a middle-of-the-night extravaganza, says Leo Ghitis, owner of Nayara Hotels, in the country\u2019s northern highlands. \u201cWe go to midnight Mass and come home and have a huge meal at 2 a.m.,\u201d he says.\n\nHomemade tamales, filled with either chicken or pork or vegetables and cheese, kick off the spread. Then it\u2019s on to arroz con pollo, Costa Rica\u2019s national rice dish that\u2019s made with green beans, peas, carrots, saffron, cilantro and a chopped up whole chicken.\n\nThe third course is an assortment of grilled proteins. Costa Ricans who live along the coast have seafood such as marlin, tuna, mahi mahi, shrimp and lobster while inlanders tuck into beef, pork and chicken. Sides are the same for both: rice with black beans, boiled palm fruit with sour cream and a hearts of palm salad with avocado.\n\nDessert is typically a coconut flan and arroz con leche \u2013 rice with milk, sugar and cinnamon.\n\n\u201cWe top off the meal with lots of rum punch and eggnog and don\u2019t finish until 4 or 5 a.m.,\u201d says Ghitis.\n\nChristmas Day itself is about finishing leftovers and hitting the streets for outdoor parties, he says.\n\nPeas and rice grace many holiday plates in the Bahamas. - Shutterstock\n\nBahamas\n\nChristmas Day is the big food celebration for Bahamians, says Vonya Ifill, the director of talent and culture at Rosewood Baha Mar.\n\nLocals have a big dinner that includes turkey, ham, macaroni and cheese, peas and rice made with coconut milk and potato salad.\n\n\u201cWe have this feast in the evening and then at midnight go off and celebrate Boxing Day with a Junkanoo Festival,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter dancing and parading around all evening and into the early morning hours, we end the festivities with a boiled fish or fish stew.\u201d\n\nThe seafood, she says, is always accompanied by potato bread or Johnny Cake, a cornmeal flatbread.\n\nThis story, which was first published in December 2020, was updated in December 2023.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

It\u2019s high time the world gave peace to Bethlehem and Gaza.\u201d",

He does not save us by pushing a button, but draws near us, in order to change our world from within.\"\n\nOn Christmas Day the Archbishop of Canterbury will use his sermon to highlight the suffering of children caught up in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe Most Rev Justin Welby is expected to say \"the skies of Bethlehem are full of fear rather than angels and glory\", referring to Jesus Christ's birthplace, which is now in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nHe will then compare the turbulent conditions of Jesus's birth with the plight of children today in the troubled region.\n\n\"Today a crying child is in a manger somewhere in the world, nobody willing or able to help his parents who desperately need shelter. Or in an incubator, in a hospital low on electricity, like al Ahli (hospital) in Gaza, surrounded by conflict,\" he will say during his sermon at Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nAlso referring to Ukraine and Sudan, Mr Welby will say: \"So many parts of the world seem beset with violence.\"\n\nHe will add that a commitment to \"serving, not in being served\" was needed to resolve problems of climate change, terrorism, economic inequality and \"the desperation and ambitions that drive more and more to migration\".\n\nRead more UK news:\n\nPicture released of King ahead of Christmas message\n\nChristmas Day set to be hottest in years\n\nAddressing the King, the Archbishop will suggest the monarch is following the example of Jesus in providing leadership through service.\n\n\"Two thousand years later, at a coronation, it seemed natural and right for a king in royal robes to answer a child, 'I come not to be served, but to serve' - and we know it to be his intention, the right way to be a king,\" Mr Welby will say, having conducted the coronation on 6 May.\n\nThe King is set to knight the Archbishop of Canterbury in the upcoming New Year Honours list, according to reports.\n\n(c) Sky News 2023: Pope offers solidarity with Bethlehem and condemns 'the futile logic of war'",

    "articleBody": "WHILE other news, both domestic and foreign, compete for people\u2019s attention, we should not forget that one of the most brutal massacres of the modern age, perpetrated by one of the world\u2019s most powerful military machines, continues in the Gaza Strip against a starved and terrorised civilian population. Since Oct 7, Israel has been doing in Gaza what it has always been doing to the Palestinian people since the Nakba, but in more concentrated fashion. The torture, murder, humiliation and pillage the Arabs of Palestine have faced since 1948 \u2014 and even before, since the Zionist encroachment of Arab land began in the early 20th century \u2014 can be seen in condensed form in what the Israeli state has unleashed over the past 80 days or so in the forsaken Strip. Gaza has become an emblem for the hypocrisy of the \u2018international community\u2019, and the complete lack of empathy many of the self-professed global champions of human rights are capable of. They play politics to protect Israel at all costs as Palestinian children cry out in unbearable pain.\n\nSome of this hypocrisy was on display at the UN Security Council, when the world body passed a resolution on Friday that called for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, yet remained silent on stopping state-sponsored Israeli violence. As many global bodies observed, the resolution is meaningless: aid will be of little use as Tel Aviv continues to bomb Gaza. This pointless resolution is the result of much hard work by the US, which did all it could to prevent calls for a meaningful ceasefire, and abstained at the time of voting. True to form, Israel dismissed even this watered-down text, reflecting what it really thinks of world opinion. Meanwhile, famine-like conditions loom in Gaza, with the UN\u2019s World Food Programme saying the Strip faces \u201ccatastrophic conditions\u201d as its people confront starvation. This is another war crime to be added to the many Israel has already committed against the Palestinians.\n\nUnfortunately, those who are trying to tell Gaza\u2019s story continue to be exterminated; the Committee to Protect Journalists recently said 68 journalists and media workers have been killed since hostilities began. The vast majority of fatalities (61) are Palestinian. Moreover, Tel Aviv has told foreign wire services that it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists in Gaza. The message is clear: whoever dares to report on the misery in Gaza could themselves become a target of Israeli bombs. Yet even the death of 20,000 Palestinians \u2014 most of them women and children \u2014 has been unable to shake the world\u2019s conscience. The bravery and steadfastness of the Palestinian people can only be commended, while their killers and tormentors have shown they are capable of truly bestial violence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, December 25th, 2023",

    "articleBody": "At least 70 are killed in central Gaza, in one of the war\u2019s deadliest strikes\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH: At least 70 people were killed in Gaza in one of the deadliest strikes of the war, health officials said Sunday, while the number of Israeli soldiers killed in combat over the weekend rose to 15.\n\nAssociated Press journalists at a nearby hospital watched frantic Palestinians carry the dead, including a baby, and wounded following the strike on the Maghazi refugee camp east of Deir al-Balah. One bloodied young girl looked stunned while her body was checked for broken bones.\n\nGaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said the toll was likely to rise. The Israeli military had no immediate comment.\n\n\u201cWe were all targeted,\u201d said Ahmad Turokmani, who lost several family members including his daughter and grandson. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza anyway.\u201d\n\nAs Christmas Eve fell, smoke rose over the besieged territory, while in the West Bank Bethlehem was hushed, its holiday celebrations called off. In neighboring Egypt, tentative efforts continued on a deal for another exchange of hostages for Palestinians held by Israel.\n\nThe war has devastated parts of Gaza, killed roughly 20,400 Palestinians and displaced almost all of the territory\u2019s 2.3 million people.\n\nThe mounting death toll among Israeli troops \u2014 154 since the ground offensive began \u2014 could erode public support for the war, which was sparked when Hamas-led militants stormed communities in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 and taking 240 hostage.\n\nIsraelis still largely stand behind the country\u2019s stated goals of crushing Hamas\u2019 governing and military capabilities and releasing the remaining 129 captives. That's despite rising international pressure against Israel\u2019s offensive, and the soaring death toll and unprecedented suffering among Palestinians.\n\nHAMAS EXACTS A PRICE\n\n\u201cThe war exacts a very heavy price from us, but we have no choice but to continue fighting,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.\n\nIn a nationally televised speech, Israeli President Isaac Herzog appealed for the country to remain united. \u201cThis moment is a test. We will not break nor blink,\u201d he said.\n\nThere has been widespread anger against his government, which many criticize for failing to protect civilians on Oct. 7 and promoting policies that allowed Hamas to gain strength over the years. Netanyahu has avoided accepting responsibility for the military and policy failures.\n\n\u201cOver time, the public will find it hard to ignore the heavy price paid, as well as the suspicion that the aims that were loudly heralded are still far from being attained, and that Hamas is showing no signs of capitulating in the near future,\" wrote Amos Harel, military affairs commentator for the Haaretz newspaper.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had completed the dismantling of Hamas\u2019 underground headquarters in northern Gaza, part of an operation to take down the vast tunnel network and kill off top commanders that Israeli leaders have said could take months.\n\nEfforts toward negotiations continued. The head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, arrived in Egypt for talks. The militant group, which also took part in the Oct. 7 attack, said it was prepared to consider releasing hostages only after fighting ends. Hamas\u2019 top leader Ismail Haniyeh traveled to Cairo for talks days earlier.\n\nINSIDE GAZA\n\nIsrael\u2019s offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than two-thirds of the 20,000 Palestinians killed have been women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said a 13-year-old boy was shot and killed in an Israeli drone attack while inside al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, a part of Gaza where Israel's military believes Hamas leaders are hiding.\n\nAn Israeli strike overnight hit a house in a refugee camp west of the city of Rafah, on Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt. At least two men were killed, according to Associated Press journalists in the hospital where the bodies were taken.\n\nAt least two people were killed and six others wounded when a missile stuck a building in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.\n\nAnd Palestinians reported heavy Israeli bombardment and gunfire in Jabaliya, an area north of Gaza City that Israel had claimed to control. Hamas\u2019 military arm said its fighters shelled Israeli troops in Jabaliya and Jabaliya refugee camp.\n\nIsrael faces international criticism for the civilian death toll but it blames Hamas, citing the militants\u2019 use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel has launched thousands of airstrikes since Oct. 7. It says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, without presenting evidence.\n\nIsrael also faces allegations of mistreating Palestinian men and teenage boys detained in homes, shelters, hospitals and elsewhere during the offensive. It has denied abuse allegations and said those without links to militants are quickly released.\n\nSpeaking to the AP from a hospital bed in Rafah after his release, Khamis al-Burdainy of Gaza City said Israeli forces detained him after tanks and bulldozers partly destroyed his home. He said men were handcuffed and blindfolded.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep. We didn\u2019t get food and water,\u201d he said, crying and covering his face.\n\nAnother released detainee, Mohammed Salem, from the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, said Israeli troops beat them. \u201cWe were humiliated,\u201d he said. \u201cA female soldier would come and beat an old man, aged 72 years old.\u201d\n\nINTERNATIONAL PRESSURE\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has passed a watered-down resolution calling for the speedy delivery of humanitarian aid for hungry and desperate Palestinians and the release of all the hostages, but not for a cease-fire.\n\nBut it was not immediately clear how and when deliveries of food, medical supplies and other aid, far below the daily average of 500 before the war, would accelerate. Trucks enter through two crossings: Rafah, and Kerem Shalom on the border with Israel. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, said 123 aid trucks entered Gaza on Sunday,\n\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated U.N. calls for a humanitarian cease-fire, adding on social media that \u201cthe decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy.\u201d\n\nAmid concerns about a wider regional conflict, the US Central Command said a patrol ship in the Red Sea on Saturday shot down four drones launched from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, a while two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into international shipping lanes.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthis say their attacks are aimed at Israel-linked ships in an effort to stop the Israeli offensive in Gaza.",

    "articleBody": "I\u2019m the kind of crazy Christmas junkie that Hallmark has made a mint on. I still cry every time Kevin McCallister runs across the foyer floor and leaps into Catherine O\u2019Hara\u2019s arms, I can recite Hugh Grant\u2019s opening monologue in Love, Actually from memory and, most importantly, I begin listening to holiday tunes before the neighbors have even taken down their Halloween decorations.\n\nI love all the hits\u2014from classic crooners like Bing Crosby and Elvis Presley to modern pop staples like John Legend and Meghan Trainor\u2014but after a few hundred listens, even the most magical song becomes a bore. Not to mention that neuroscientists now say the \u201cincessant repetition\u201d of Christmas songs all season long can lead to cognitive fatigue and even negatively impact your mental health.\n\nSo a few years back, I began compiling the best off-the-beaten-path holiday tunes I could find. Some were unique covers of well-known songs by lesser-known artists, and others were obscure song and artist combinations I\u2019d never heard before. I scoured Spotify, rummaged around the internet and enlisted the help of similarly festive friends. Like most Christmas songs, they weren\u2019t all the height of music because that\u2019s not the point of holiday tunes anyway. Their magic is meant to make you feel a certain kind of way\u2014nostalgic, wistful, gleeful, sometimes even sad. And since it\u2019s the season of giving, I figured I\u2019d offer a sampling of the songs I\u2019ve compiled for other holiday lovers out there who are sick of listening to Mariah Carey on repeat and need a refresh. Without further ado, here are some of the most underrated Christmas songs of all time, all of which should be in your rotation this holiday season.\n\nAudrey Assad: \u201cBells\u201d\n\nAll seven tracks on Nashville-based singer-songwriter Audrey Assad\u2019s Peace could be on this list, but \u201cBells\u201d is simply unmissable. It\u2019s a stunning rearrangement of the popular Christmas carol based on American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\u2019s 1863 poem \u201cI Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.\u201d Written during the tumult of the American Civil War, the narrator laments that \u201chate is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth, goodwill to men,\u201d making the old hymn relevant to our current social situation. Assad\u2019s haunting, high-pitched voice set against the modern rearrangement that builds in complexity as the song progresses is a tractor-beam that draws listeners like a siren as despair is replaced by hope. The narrator concludes, \u201cGod is not dead, nor doth he sleep\u201d and will ultimately bring peace to this war-torn earth.\n\nBahamas: \u201cChristmas Must Be Tonight\u201d\n\nMany fans of The Band have lamented that \u201cChristmas Must Be Tonight\u201d never became the holiday classic that it deserved to be, despite being featured on the soundtrack of Bill Murray\u2019s 1988 film Scrooged!. The song was an outtake from a previous album that was included on The Band\u2019s final studio record, Islands, and tells of Christ\u2019s birth from the perspective of an onlooking shepherd. This version by Canadian musician Bahamas (aka Alfie Jurvanen) honors the original iteration while also altering it, combining reverberating guitar riffs with Jurvanen\u2019s trademark creaky voice to convey a folksy, festive warmth.\n\nFleet Foxes: \u201cWhite Winter Hymnal\u201d\n\n\u201cWinter White Hymnal\u201d by the Seattle-based indie band Fleet Foxes is basically one short verse repeated three times over roughly two minutes that\u2019s only festive in the vaguest of ways. And yet, there\u2019s something about the song that makes it not only reflective but addictive. Maybe it\u2019s the sound, oddly reminiscent of the Beach Boys, which feels nostalgic even though the song was released in 2008. Or maybe it\u2019s the springy arrangement, beginning in a simple round before building into a blend of percussion-rich instrumentation and vocal harmonies. Whatever it is, this is a track that inexplicably ends up on repeat during the holidays.\n\nFruit Bats: \u201cBaby in the Hay\u201d\n\nSometimes the only thing you want and need from a Christmas song is a re-telling of the familiar birth story behind it all. That\u2019s exactly what the indie rock band Fruit Bats deliver to listeners in \u201cBaby in the Hay.\u201d You probably haven\u2019t heard it, since this single track is tucked away on a holiday compilation album called You Wish, released by North Carolina-based independent label Merge Records. The song\u2019s lyrics simply tell the traditional tale you probably know all too well, but the story is delivered with enrapturing harmonies accented by a Country-Western tinge that adds newness to nostalgia. It\u2019s definitely worth adding to your holiday rotation.\n\nHush Kids: \u201cJingle Your Bells\u201d\n\nThe Nashville-based alt-country duo Hush Kids say they chose their band\u2019s name because they felt the word \u201chush\u201d described the softness and tranquility of most of their songs. If true, \u201cJingle Your Bells\u201d is something of a departure. It\u2019s uptempo and ebullient, a flirtatious telling of two lovers losing themselves in mutual affection at home during Christmas. With cookies baking, they dance throughout a house in which every room is adorned with mistletoe in every room of their house. The pair alternate singing to each other as the lyrics transition from nice to naughty: \u201cI\u2019m gonna jingle your bells when you\u2019re not lookin\u2019 // Gonna deck your halls while the goose is cookin\u2019 // Neighbors will be wishin\u2019 for a silent night // Peeking through the window with a big flashlight.\u201d When the song wraps, you\u2019ll wonder how this bouncy tune has evaded becoming a highly-streamed seasonal favorite.\n\nJohn Adams: \u201cLonely This Christmas\u201d\n\nAny Christmas movie junkie knows that one of the genre\u2019s recurrent themes is longing for an absent loved one and, on the sadness scale, \u201cLonely This Christmas\u201d is hard to beat. Originating from the British glam rock band Mud in 1974, the song does not merely admit the loneliness of the season; it wallows in it. Enter U.K.-based singer/songwriter John Adams, whose voice feels oddly reminiscent of Sam Smith and James Blunt, and, somehow, makes this classic even more melancholy and moving. Adam\u2019s unique presentation is decidedly minimalist, singing in falsetto tones accompanied by nothing more than a softly-tapped piano, that force listeners to reckon with the lyrics, which manage to exude misery without becoming overwrought.\n\nLeigh Nash: \u201cPretty Paper\u201d\n\nLeigh Nash was once the lead vocalist for the alternative Christian band Sixpence None the Richer who gained global recognition for singing hits such as \u201cKiss Me\u201d and \u201cThere She Goes.\u201d Now solo, Nash released a cover of \u201cPretty Paper,\u201d inspired by the true story of a street vendor in Texas who sold paper and pencils outside of a department store at Christmastime. The song was written by Willie Nelson in 1963 and first recorded by Roy Orbison, but it\u2019s been covered by numerous country music legends\u2014like Glenn Campbell, Dolly Parton, Randy Travis and Kenny Chesney. Nash puts her own spin on it, opting for a playful piano arrangement as her trademark high-pitch vocals add a unique flair to the classic.\n\nMeiko: \u201cMerry Christmas Wherever You Are\u201d\n\nWhat is Christmas if not a time to pine for long-lost ex-lovers? Singer/songwriter Meiko\u2019s \u201cMerry Christmas Wherever You Are\u201d puts words to the sense of loss and longing that so many feel: \u201cThe snow is falling and nobody is calling me to say hello / So I sit and think of the coulda woulda\u2019s / Why\u2019d you have to go leaving me all alone.\u201d But this is not an uncheerful or depressing ballad by any stretch. The mid-tempo, bouncy track blends piano, percussion and background vocals that\u2019s vaguely reminiscent of 1950s doo-wop. And the woman in Meiko\u2019s song ultimately resists the temptation to despair, choosing to decorate her television set with Christmas lights and mustering the resolve to wish the absent former partner a \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\nOver the Rhine: \u201cDarlin\u2019 (Christmas is Coming)\u201d\n\nFor those who\u2019ve just survived a particularly trying and tumultuous year, Christmas and New Year\u2019s represent an opportunity for healing and new beginnings. That\u2019s the sentiment beneath \u201cDarlin\u2019 (Christmas is Coming),\u201d a lesser-known original song from Ohio-based band Over the Rhine. Vocalist Karin Bergquist\u2019s distinctive quavering vocals almost channel Joni Mitchell in a tune that mixes traditional holiday imagery\u2014such as Salvation Army bell ringers, with deeper ruminations (\u201cSnow is falling, falling like forgiveness from the sky\u201d)\u2014with the power to spark and stir hope.\n\nPassenger and Stu Larsen: \u201cHappy Christmas, My Dear\u201d\n\nThere are only so many ways to say \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d but perhaps none feel warmer than \u201cHappy Christmas, My Dear,\u201d a song from English indie-folk musician Passenger (aka Mike Rosenberg) that features Australian singer/songwriter Stu Larsen. Both artists have been known to sing about wanderlust, so it\u2019s no surprise that this track offer well-wishes to nomads, wanderers, and those who find themselves far from home: \u201cI hope you find the right road to take // And seldom dwell upon all these mistakes // I hope you\u2019re happy with the choices you make // Happy Christmas my dear.\u201d The intimate arrangement with free-flowing harmonies creates a coffeehouse feel that\u2019s both comfortable and comforting, and the sound of a crackling fire in the background doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\nPhoebe Bridgers: \u201cIf We Make It Through December\u201d\n\nSongs like Merle Haggard\u2019s \u201cIf We Make It Through December,\u201d released in 1973, remind us that not every Christmas song is merry and bright. But indie-folk artist Phoebe Bridgers transforms this track into something even more somber, deconstructing Haggard\u2019s follow-the-bouncing-ball melody into a melancholic tune more aligned with the song\u2019s lyrics. While this track won\u2019t make listeners rock around the Christmas tree, its explorations of hard luck, financial difficulty and gnawing loneliness offer solace to those for whom the holidays are hard or even painful or altogether avoided.\n\nRhys Lewis: \u201cChristmas Eve\u201d\n\nBritish musician Rhys Lewis has put out two Christmas tracks that deserve to be on this list, \u201cThis Time of Year\u201d and \u201cChristmas Eve.\u201d I decided to feature the latter because, well, it\u2019s a more entertaining listen. The song tells the story of someone who \u201chad a little bit too much fun on Christmas Eve\u201d and woke up on the big day with a hangover, eyes \u201cas red as Rudolph\u2019s nose.\u201d (It happens to the best of us, amiright?) Lewis\u2019 soulful voice complements the multi-instrumental presentation of smooth saxophone, punchy trumpet and playful piano. It will make you want to stand up from your easy chair and recreate the very scenario the song subtly warns against.\n\nSara Bareilles and Ingrid Michaelson: \u201cWinter Song\u201d\n\nListeners of Sara Bareilles will likely be familiar with this song because the singer/songwriter\u2019s fans track her every move like bloodhounds, but others may find \u201cWinter Song\u201d to be a delightful discovery. Bareilles teamed up with another celebrated singer/songwriter, Ingrid Michaelson, to produce this tune, which centers on the power of love to sustain us amid life\u2019s chilliest and most barren seasons. The melody begins subdued but grows energetically as the duo\u2019s voices alternate from unison to harmony, stirring hopefulness and optimism along the way. By the time the track ends with the repetition of a question\u2014\u201dIs love alive?\u201d\u2014the listener has been long convinced that it is, indeed.\n\nSharon Van Etten: \u201cSilent Night\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to make a song composed more than 200 years ago that most people have heard at least as many times sound fresh and even foreign. And yet, that\u2019s exactly what Sharon Van Etten accomplishes on \u201cSilent Night.\u201d Her version of the song begins with a minimal, metronomic bassline and then layers in her multi-tracked voice and an ominous organ. The melody continues to build and the vocals grow, rousing unexpected curiosity and appreciation for a tune you\u2019ve heard a bazillion times over. It\u2019s quite an achievement.\n\nSleeping at Last: \u201cChristmas is All Around\u201d\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking, and yes, this is a cover of the infamous song from the 2003 movie Love, Actually. In that film, a washed-up musician named Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) has recorded a Christmas cover of the 1967 hit song \u201cLove is All Around\u201d by the English rock band The Troggs. But Sleeping at Last (aka Ryan O\u2019Neal) adapted the holiday version on his first Christmas album, stripping the slick, multi-instrumental arrangement down to a barebones acoustic presentation that allows O\u2019Neal\u2019s tender vocals to entice listeners on their own merits. Both of Sleeping at Last\u2019s holiday records make for mandatory listening on cozy, overcast December days, but \u201cChristmas is All Around\u201d adds a subtle playfulness that makes it of special note.\n\nThe Decemberists: \u201cJesus Christ\u201d\n\nWhile Portland indie rock band The Decemberists have long been known for musical storytelling, their largely unknown Christmas tune \u201cJesus Christ\u201d offers a simple but vibrant proclamation of the birth of Christ. The alternating electric guitar and piano solos keep the refrain of \u201cJesus Christ was born today, Jesus Christ was born\u201d from feeling too repetitive, and the track presents instead as something of an earworm. This three-minute holiday jam feels as energetic and alive as the arriving newborn announced by its lyrics and is deserving of notice.\n\nThe O\u2019Pears: \u201cRiver\u201d\n\nWhen Toronto-based folk trio The O\u2019Pears decided to make their sophomore album, Stay Warm, they explicitly avoided making \u201ca commercial Christmas album\u201d and, instead, sought to produce a mix of covers and originals\u2014some delivered a cappella and others accompanied by light instrumentation\u2014that \u201cexamine the many ways that the holidays can bring rest, joy, and cheer while also inspiring feelings of loss, grief, and nostalgia.\u201d The whole album is worth a listen, but the group\u2019s cover of fellow Canadian Joni Mitchell\u2019s \u201cRiver\u201d is particularly noteworthy for its gentle acoustic accompaniment that allows the enrapturing harmonies to shine as bright as a tree-topper.\n\nY La Bamba: \u201cSe\u00f1or Santa\u201d\n\nIn 1955, songwriter Pat Ballard rewrote the lyrics to his famous song \u201cMr. Sandman\u201d for Christmas use as \u201cMr. Santa.\u201d More than half a century later, Mexican-American singer-songwriter Luz Elena Mendoza and her folk pop band Y La Bamba reimagined it once more as \u201cSe\u00f1or Santa.\u201d Mendoza\u2019s music is marked by a dream-like inventiveness that\u2019s rendered in a blend of Spanish and English, and this song follows suit by giving the pop classic a Latin flair. Combining classical guitar riffs with accordion, ukulele and even whistling, this song transforms into something starkly unique without sacrificing its original festive spirit. Tucked away on a (very good) compilation album titled \u201cHolidays Rule,\u201d this track doubtlessly deserves to be added to your Christmas rotation.\n\nZee Avi: \u201cNo Christmas for Me\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Christmas for Me\u201d by Malaysian singer/songwriter Zee Avi is the story of a pining lover who decides she is boycotting Christmas, since her sweetheart is away from home. She rattles off the list of all the holiday traditions that have been embargoed: no eggnog, no mulled wine, no Christmas tree, and stockings as empty as her heart. You can\u2019t help but feel sorry for this lovesick soul until\u2014spoiler alert\u2014her baby comes back with only two days to spare and saves Christmas for the both of them. The song combines the kind of simple storytelling and accessible emotionalism that makes holiday songs both endearing and enduring.\n\nZoe De La Sera: \u201cChristmas for Cowboys\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand how Zoe De La Sera\u2019s cover of \u201cChristmas for Cowboys\u201d has escaped the notice of the public. There\u2019s scant information about De La Sera online, and I couldn\u2019t even find her official website. Regardless, this little-known artist created a stripped-down version of John Denver\u2019s 1975 composition that manages to be beautiful by its very simplicity. The song tells the story of a cattle rancher sitting tall in the saddle on Christmas day and reflecting on the unpretentiousness of holiday celebrations in contrast to the flashy festivities common to the big city. The spacious cadence of De La Sera\u2019s unadorned version embodies Denver\u2019s message and contrasts starkly with the corny, schmaltzy tone of too many Christmas songs.\n\nListen to a playlist of these 20 songs below.\n\nJonathan Merritt is an award-winning columnist, cultural commentator and author of Learning to Speak God from Scratch.",

In neighboring Egypt, tentative efforts continued on a deal for another exchange of hostages for Palestinians held by Israel.\n\nThe mounting death toll among Israeli troops \u2014 154 since the ground offensive began \u2014 could erode public support for the war, which was sparked when Hamas-led militants stormed communities in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 and taking 240 hostage.\n\nThe war has devastated parts of Gaza, killed roughly 20,400 Palestinians and displaced almost all of the territory\u2019s 2.3 million people. The Health Ministry in Gaza said 166 people were killed in the coastal enclave over the past day.\n\nIsraelis still largely stand behind the country\u2019s stated goals of crushing Hamas\u2019 governing and military capabilities and releasing the remaining 129 captives. That\u2019s despite rising international pressure against Israel\u2019s offensive, and the soaring death toll and unprecedented suffering among Palestinians.\n\nIsraeli soldiers carry the casket of Staff Sgt.

We will not break nor blink,\u201d he said.\n\nThere has been widespread anger against his government, which many criticize for failing to protect civilians on Oct. 7 and promoting policies that allowed Hamas to gain strength over the years. Netanyahu has avoided accepting responsibility for the military and policy failures.\n\n\u201cOver time, the public will find it hard to ignore the heavy price paid, as well as the suspicion that the aims that were loudly heralded are still far from being attained, and that Hamas is showing no signs of capitulating in the near future,\u201d wrote Amos Harel, military affairs commentator for the Haaretz newspaper.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had completed the dismantling of Hamas\u2019 underground headquarters in northern Gaza, part of an operation to take down the vast tunnel network and kill off top commanders that Israeli leaders have said could take months.\n\nEfforts toward negotiations continued. The head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, arrived in Egypt for talks. The militant group, which also took part in the Oct. 7 attack, said it was prepared to consider releasing hostages only after fighting ends. Hamas\u2019 top leader Ismail Haniyeh traveled to Cairo for talks days earlier.\n\nIsrael\u2019s offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than two-thirds of the 20,000 Palestinians killed have been women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nElsewhere, the Palestinian Red Crescent said a 13-year-old boy was shot and killed in an Israeli drone attack while inside al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, a part of Gaza where Israel\u2019s military believes Hamas leaders are hiding.\n\nAn Israeli strike overnight hit a house in a refugee camp west of the city of Rafah, on Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt. At least two men were killed, according to Associated Press journalists in the hospital where the bodies were taken.\n\nAt least two people were killed and six others wounded when a missile stuck a building in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.\n\nAnd Palestinians reported heavy Israeli bombardment and gunfire in Jabaliya, an area north of Gaza City that Israel had claimed to control. Hamas\u2019 military arm said its fighters shelled Israeli troops in Jabaliya and Jabaliya refugee camp.\n\nIsrael faces international criticism for the civilian death toll but it blames Hamas, citing the militants\u2019 use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel has launched thousands of airstrikes since Oct. 7. It says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, without presenting evidence.\n\nIsrael also faces allegations of mistreating Palestinian men and teenage boys detained in homes, shelters, hospitals and elsewhere during the offensive. It has denied abuse allegations and said those without links to militants are quickly released.\n\nSpeaking to the AP from a hospital bed in Rafah after his release, Khamis al-Burdainy of Gaza City said Israeli forces detained him after tanks and bulldozers partly destroyed his home. He said men were handcuffed and blindfolded.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep. We didn\u2019t get food and water,\u201d he said, crying and covering his face.\n\nAnother released detainee, Mohammed Salem, from the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, said Israeli troops beat them. \u201cWe were humiliated,\u201d he said. \u201cA female soldier would come and beat an old man, aged 72 years old.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has passed a watered-down resolution calling for the speedy delivery of humanitarian aid for hungry and desperate Palestinians and the release of all the hostages, but not for a cease-fire.\n\nBut it was not immediately clear how and when deliveries of food, medical supplies and other aid, far below the daily average of 500 before the war, would accelerate. Trucks enter through two crossings \u2014 Rafah, and Kerem Shalom on the border with Israel. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, said 93 aid trucks entered Gaza through Rafah on Saturday.\n\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated U.N. calls for a humanitarian cease-fire, adding on social media that \u201cthe decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy.\u201d\n\nAmid concerns about a wider regional conflict, the U.S. Central Command said a patrol ship in the Red Sea on Saturday shot down four drones launched from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, a while two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into international shipping lanes.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthis say their attacks are aimed at Israel-linked ships in an effort to stop the Israeli offensive in Gaza.",

    "articleBody": "Bethlehem fell silent on 25 December 2023, Christmas Day, choosing not to celebrate the birth of Jesus, who is believed to have been born in this city. Bethlehem is a Palestinian town south of Jerusalem , a town that is seeing the atrocities of Israel's aerial bombing campaign and ground attacks in the Gaza Strip. Bethlehem fell silent on Monday, with no Christmas tree, no caroling, as the ongoing attack by Israel in West Bank left hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops deserted.\n\nBethlehem, considered the birthplace of Jesus, is now in the middle of a war zone. The pilgrimage town for believers in Christianity has this year chosen the side of the oppressed- solidarity with Palestine.\n\nAmong other signs of solidarity is a Holy Family Cave, a sculpture that depicts a harrowing tableau- a bombed-out version of the traditional nativity cave. The mural draws a comparison with the journey of Christ and his family, when they had to flee Bethlehem under an oppressive ruler to Egypt, before returning to Nazareth two millennia ago.\n\nThe sculptures are surrounded by barbed wire, and rocks. The Virgin Mary embraces the baby Jesus, while Joseph embraces her, offering solace. On one side of the family, the Magi holds out a white shroud. On the other side, the fourth shepherd carries a bag, a symbol of Palestinian displacement.\n\nAngels, suspended around the rubble, represent the souls of children who have been victims of massacres on Palestinian land throughout history: the murder of children in Bethlehem by Herod at the birth of Jesus; various colonial attacks against the Palestinian people and their ancestors; and current massacres by Israel in Gaza.\n\nAccording to Al Jazeera report, Hana Hanania, the mayor of Bethlehem, said the sculpture aims to showcase Palestinian suffering everywhere. Churches, clergy and civilians in Gaza are being bombarded, and a blockade is enforced in the West Bank, particularly in Bethlehem.\n\nThe cave\u2019s roof is a geographical map of Gaza. Its shape, together with a depiction of an explosion, form a star, inspired by the Star of Bethlehem that led the Magi to Jesus\u2019s birth. This conveys a message of hope.\n\nNotably in other parts of Bethlehem, installations adorned the town that would have otherwise celebrated Christmas today. This includes a child in a dummy incubator, signifying the innumerable children who lost their lives in Gaza, due to Israeli attacks, which also paralyzed the densely populated area's healthcare system.\n\nAround the town, multilingual panels call for a ceasefire and an end to the massacre against the Palestinian people.\n\nMilestone Alert!

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)\n\nROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis on Monday blasted the weapons industry and its \u201cinstruments of death\u201d that fuel wars as he made a Christmas Day appeal for peace in the world and in particular between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nSpeaking from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to the throngs of people below, Francis said he grieved the \u201cabominable attack\u201d of Hamas against southern Israel on Oct. 7 and called for the release of hostages. And he begged for an end to Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza and the \u201cappalling harvest of innocent civilians\u201d as he called for humanitarian aid to reach those in need.\n\nFrancis devoted his Christmas Day blessing to a call for peace in the world, noting that the biblical story of the birth of Christ in Bethlehem sent a message of peace. But he said that Bethlehem \u201cis a place of sorrow and silence\u201d this year.\n\nFrancis\u2019 annual \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d (\"To the City and the World\") speech typically offers a lament of all the misery facing the world, and this year\u2019s edition was no different. From Armenia and Azerbaijan to Syria and Yemen, Ukraine to South Sudan and Congo and the Korean peninsula, Francis appealed for humanitarian initiatives, dialogue and security to prevail over violence and death.\n\nHe called for governments and people of goodwill in the Americas in particular to address the \u201ctroubling phenomenon\u201d of migration and its \u201cunscrupulous traffickers\u201d who take advantage of innocents just looking for a better life.\n\nHe took particular aim at the weapons industry, which he said was fueling the conflicts around the globe with scarcely anyone paying attention.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\n\u201cIt should be talked about and written about, so as to bring to light the interests and the profits that move the puppet strings of war,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd how can we even speak of peace, when arms production, sales and trade are on the rise?\u201d\n\nFrancis has frequently blasted the weapons industry as \u201cmerchants of death\u201d and has said that wars today, in Ukraine, in particular, are being used to try out new weapons or use up old stockpiles.\n\nHe called for peace between Israel and Palestinians, and for the conflict to be resolved \u201cthrough sincere and persevering dialogue between the parties, sustained by strong political will and the support of the international community.\u201d\n\nVatican officials said about 70,000 people filled St. Peter's Square for Francis' noonday speech and blessing. They included many people flying Palestinian flags, as well as some Ukrainian ones.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nFrancis' address from the loggia marked his main appearance for Christmas Day, though he is expected to deliver a blessing on Tuesday, the feast of St. Stephen, which is also a holiday in Italy. Rounding out the holiday, he is to celebrate a New Year's Eve vigil in the basilica and Mass the following day.\n\nDespite his recent bout of bronchitis, the 87-year-old Francis appeared to hold up well Monday and during Christmas Eve Mass the previous night, though he occasionally coughed and seemed out of breath.",

His message, delivered amidst the backdrop of relentless conflict, drew a powerful metaphor, likening the dire circumstances in Gaza to a world where Jesus is born amidst the rubble. Isaac\u2019s address condemned the violence against innocent children and demanded an end to what he termed \u2018genocide\u2019.

Harry Shoup, ordered his staff to check the radar to see where Old Saint Nick might be and update the children on his location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmed with radars, sensors and aircraft, the NORAD in Colorado keeps a close watch on Santa and his sleigh from the moment he leaves the North Pole. NORAD shares all those details so children can follow along as Santa travels the globe beginning Christmas Eve, Dec. 24, 2023.

    "articleBody": "The U.N. Security Council room, this Thursday after confirming a new delay in the vote. SHANNON STAPLETON (REUTERS)\n\nAfter intense negotiations that lasted almost a week, the United States on Friday lifted its objection to a draft United Nations Security Council resolution to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza at a time when the population of the Strip is facing the certain threat of hunger. In the vote, postponed repeatedly since Monday, the 15-member Council approved the text by 13-0 with two abstentions from the United States and Russia. The wording of the document is a compromise solution that involved watering down the initial resolution, in the opinion of several members of the Council.\n\nThe cessation or suspension of hostilities to allow the entry of aid and a mechanism for monitoring shipments \u2014 the two pillars of the proposal presented a week ago by the United Arab Emirates \u2014 have been diluted into vague initiatives (\u201durgent steps\u201d to allow aid and \u201ca coordinator\u201d appointed by the U.N.) that did not satisfy some members of the Council, such as Russia, nor many others in the General Assembly, such as the group of Arab countries.\n\nThe key provision originally called for \u201cthe urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities.\u201d Instead, the final wording calls for \u201curgent steps to immediately allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and also for creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.\u201d Diplomatic sources consulted by the AP agency had earlier celebrated that, if approved, this would be the Council\u2019s first reference to a cessation of hostilities.\n\nAll eyes were on the Russian representative, Vasily Nebenzya, who was dissatisfied with the thinning of the original text and who presented an amendment to include a call for a ceasefire, supported by 10 members of the Council but vetoed by the United States. Curiously, Russia has agreed with the United States by abstaining from voting on the resolution, although for very different reasons. In addition to the vague request for \u201curgent measures\u201d to allow unimpeded access to the necessary supplies, the main reason for discussion since the Emirates presented the draft resolution last Friday has been the establishment of a control mechanism by the U.N. of all aid shipments that cross into the Strip to ensure that trucks do not introduce weapons or smuggled goods. The United States, as Israel\u2019s voice in the Council, has resisted approving this measure, considering that it further complicated the distribution of aid, which is why the initial request has been transformed into a call to the Secretary General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, to appoint \u201ca senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator with responsibility for facilitating, coordinating, monitoring and verifying\u201d that deliveries are of a humanitarian nature. Israel is reluctant to hand that task to third parties, and the U.S. has managed to get the Council to tone down the original request.\n\nEleventh-hour talks between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterparts from the Emirates \u2014 the only Arab country that sits on the Council \u2014 and Egypt \u2014 through which aid enters the Strip \u2014 have been key to ironing out the existing differences on the draft. This was made clear by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, after a closed-door meeting of the Council held on Thursday afternoon. She said the U.S. worked hard and diligently all last week with Egypt and the Emirates to ensure the implementation of \u201ca mechanism to support the humanitarian aid\u201d that Gaza desperately needs. \u201cWe are ready to vote on it,\u201d said the diplomat, who explained that the final text is the result of Blinken\u2019s negotiation with Egypt and the Emirates, bypassing the other 13 members of the Council, several of whom opposed being left out, according to diplomatic sources.\n\nWhich way the U.S. would vote was not clear: an abstention was enough to move the resolution forward, although on Thursday night the threat of a veto was still there. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you how I\u2019m going to vote,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield declared Thursday, adding that if the resolution was presented as written, the United States \u201ccan support it.\u201d Security Council resolutions are, theoretically, binding and require at least nine votes in favor and no veto to be approved.\n\nSeveral members of the Council, including Russia and France, both with veto power, like the United States, were not satisfied with the latest corrections to the text, while some diplomatic sources wondered how getting aid into the Strip will be ensured if the fighting does not stop. The concept \u201ccessation or suspension of hostilities\u201d is a red line for the United States and Israel, who consider that it would only benefit Hamas. Furthermore, the new formulation of the text calls on all parties to adhere to international humanitarian law and deplores all attacks against civilians and civilian assets, as well as all violence and hostilities against civilians and all acts of terrorism.\n\nThe U.S. was alone against the world in two earlier U.N. votes on Gaza. The first, a ceasefire resolution from the Council, which it vetoed on December 8. The second, its rejection of another practically identical resolution that was passed by a large majority in the General Assembly, four days later. Then, only nine countries, including Israel, supported their rejection of the text. Despite the notorious isolation of the United States in the U.N. regarding the Gaza war \u2014 similar to that of Russia since the Ukraine war began \u2014 the threat of its veto power has managed to break the will of the other 14 members of the Council, reflected in a much more ambitious initial proposal.",

The sites include military sites where Hezbollah members operated and other infrastructure, the IDF said.\n\nMeanwhile, the IDF said it carried out strikes against more than 300 targets in the Gaza Strip over the past day. Ground forces carried out some of the strikes against Hamas operatives amid battles, The Times of Israel reported. It said that Air Force and Navy strikes over the past day have killed dozens of Hamas terrorists and destroyed the infrastructure of the terror group.\n\nOne of the airstrikes hit a Hamas rocket launcher used to fire long-range projectiles at Israel on Tuesday, according to the IDF. The IDF said troops of the 55th Brigade raided Hamas sites in southern Gaza's Khan Younis after they came under fire from them, The Times of Israel reported. It said soldiers found a large weapons cache, including firearms, ammunition, explosive devices and around 20 mortars.\n\nOn Tuesday, the IDF said that troops have found 1500 tunnel shafts and underground passages in Gaza since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas. According to IDF, the majority of these shafts have been found beneath schools, hospitals, mosques.\n\n\"1,500 tunnel shafts and underground passages have been exposed in Gaza by our troops since the beginning of the war.

(Photo: AFP)\n\nNEW YORK - The United Nations (UN) Security Council voted on Friday to approve a resolution that demands all sides in the Israel-Hamas conflict allow the \"safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale.\"\n\nAfter days of delays, the resolution also called for the creation of \"conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities\" but it did not call for an immediate end to fighting.\n\nRussia and the United States, which both could have vetoed the measure as permanent members of the council, abstained, meaning it passed with 13 votes in favour.\n\nNonetheless, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield called the resolution \"a strong step forward.\"\n\n\"This council provided a glimmer of hope among a sea of suffering,\" she said.\n\nDiplomatic wrangling at UN headquarters in Manhattan -- causing the vote to be postponed several times this week -- has come against the backdrop of deteriorating conditions in Gaza and a mounting death toll.\n\nRussian ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya hit out at the US, saying \"they have resorted to their favourite tactic... of twisting of arms\", calling the text \"toothless.\"\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) sponsored the resolution, which was amended in several key areas to secure compromise.\n\nThe UAE's ambassador to the UN Lana Zaki Nusseibeh said \"it responds with action to the dire humanitarian situation.\"\n\n\"We know this is not a perfect text...

Adorned in traditional white robes, the Pope delivered a homily that touched on the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem and its stark contrast to the escalating conflicts around the world today. The Pope\u2019s message underscored the \u2018futile logic of war\u2019 that continues to thwart global peace, citing the recent surge in violence incited by Hamas in Israel.\n\nUnveiling the Symbol of Unity and Peace\n\nDuring the Mass, Pope Francis unveiled a statuette of the Christ child, a significant gesture that drew the attention of the world. In a poignant display of unity and peace, children from various nations placed flowers around a throne, a symbol that transcended linguistic and cultural barriers. The Pope, despite his knee issue requiring the use of a wheelchair for long distances, carried a life-sized statue of Baby Jesus and placed it in a nativity scene inside the basilica, an act that resonated with the congregation and the global audience alike.\n\nA Call Against Worldly Power\n\nThroughout his sermon, Pope Francis spoke fervently against the pursuit of worldly power. He emphasized the humble origins of Jesus\u2019 entry into the world and the merciful nature of God, drawing a clear line between a deity associated with power and success and the Christian God. The Pope said, \u2018God does not save us by pushing a button but draws near us in order to change our world from within.\u2019 This statement served as a stark reminder of the vast gulf between the pursuit of worldly dominance and the teachings of Christianity.\n\nChristmas Day: The Blessing and the Message\n\nOn Christmas Day, Pope Francis delivered the traditional Angelus blessing to tens of thousands who had gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square. His message was one of empathy and compassion, reminding the multitudes of those suffering due to wars in regions like Ukraine and Gaza. He urged the faithful to celebrate Christmas with simplicity, devoid of consumerism, emphasizing the importance of sharing and caring for one another. The Christmas Eve Mass, held at 7:30 p.m. in recent years, earlier than its traditional midnight time, reflects adjustments made considering the health of the popes and the ongoing pandemic.\n\nOlalekan Adigun Hailing from the vibrant heart of Africa, Olalekan Adigun stands as a seasoned journalist and editor with a rich legacy in digital journalism.

    "articleBody": "Christmas message is that innocent Palestinian lives matter\n\nFather Majdi Seryani\n\nClergyman sits at the Church of the Nativity, believed to be built above the birthplace of Jesus Christ, in Bethlehem. (AFP)\n\nShort Url https://arab.news/wf42g\n\nServing our Lord in Jerusalem has been the privilege and pride of my priestly order. I cherish working with our Palestinian Christian community in what the late Pope John Paul II called \u201cthe mother of Churches\u201d in Jerusalem and the center of the Christian world. This Holy Land has always been proud of its role of re-living Christ and Christianity.\n\nBut this year is different, hugely different. The home of the nativity is not lit this year. Bethlehem is not singing its carols, and thousands of pilgrims are not filling its streets and churches. Instead, we are reliving the cries as immortalized in the Bible: \u201cRachel cries for her children. And she cannot be comforted because her children are dead!\u201d\n\nIt is unbelievably strange how today\u2019s Christmas story is like that of 2,000 years ago. Mary and Joseph were forced to run away and seek refuge in Egypt to avoid the wrath of Herod.\n\nInstead of the Christmas tree and the grotto, one church in Bethlehem has placed the baby child among rubble as a way of reflecting the situation facing those in Gaza. Mothers running in fear with their children to an unknown future is the image of Mary running with the baby Jesus. We see in those eyes the eyes of the Virgin Mary, and in their faces we see the baby Jesus.\n\nNothing is more revolting about this horrific war than the killing of the innocent. There is no way to re-live the birth of Christ and to unite around it with a dispassionate approach.\n\nOct. 7 was an unabashed hell. Our thoughts and prayers cannot but mourn the innocent lives on both sides, brutalized and murdered. We need to remember, at midnight prayers, that innocent blood is shed in sorrow and misery, and our prayer will be that of the prophet Isaiah: \u201cOh radiance of eternal light, Oh sun of justice: come, illuminate those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death.\u201d\n\nAny moral approach to understanding the hell that has broken loose must be seen only through the perspective of 75 years of exile and military occupation.\n\nSince Oct. 7, the real victims of this sheer brutality on both Israeli and Palestinian sides are innocent civilians. Each of them is a dear and beloved soul to someone.\n\nTens of thousands have been killed and injured, hundreds of thousands displaced and made refugees for the third or fourth time in their lives; hunger and thirst, loss and sorrow \u2014 no one needs to wait for the day after the war to do something.\n\nAt the same time, we witness the utterly dishonest, biased media coverage that fails to shed any light on the reality of those innocent deaths, while sometimes, at best, making a casual remark about those calamities.\n\nAny moral approach to understanding the hell that has broken loose must be seen only through the perspective of 75 years of exile and military occupation. Father Majdi Seryani\n\nThis brutal eruption of fatal violence is the result of decades of injustice and neglect. Peace for both sides cannot be brought about except through the justice outlined and articulated time and time again by dozens of UN resolutions.\n\nAntisemitism apartheid, racism and many other moral issues are defying an international value system. Today we hope Palestine, through Gaza, will have its place among these issues. Today what is taking place in Gaza must put all of us to a moral and faith test, whether as individuals, communities or states.\n\nThe proclamation of the Glory of God in Heaven and Peace on Earth has been brutally silenced and all we hear is the sound of the weeping of Gaza\u2019s mothers bidding farewell to their assassinated children. They have become the target of this unprecedented diabolic aggression.\n\nIn Gaza, there are three churches, three schools and multiple humanitarian projects in the Gaza Strip. But our organizations and our people are currently fighting for their very existence amid the unlawful Israeli assault that has spared no one.\n\nAs for Palestinian Christians, the war has devasted the tiny community, which will inevitably lead to mass emigration. We need to know that it is this dire situation created by an illegal and brutal occupation that deprives locals, Muslims and Christians alike, of any political stability and is causing this exodus.\n\nInstability and the lack of every facet needed \u2014 jobs, education, sanitary services, you name it \u2014 is the real cause of this emigration. Our role in Gaza as the Lord has ordered us is to be the salt of the earth among our people.\n\nBefore taking my current job, as chief justice of the Latin Ecclesiastical Appeal Courts, I was a few times asked to accompany the late PLO leader Yasser Arafat to various local and international meetings.\n\nAt one time in Gaza I accompanied Latin Patriarch Michel Sabah and Anglican Bishop Riah Abu El-Assal on a peace-making mission with the founder of the Hamas movement, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin.\n\nDirecting his words to us, the paraplegic leader repeated what we already knew about the depth of relations between Palestinian Christians and Muslims. He praised the public service of Christians and insisted on the importance of strengthening the Palestinian Christian presence in Palestine.

    "articleBody": "Heavy civilian casualties are the cost of Israel\u2019s intense campaign to destroy Hamas in Gaza and the militants\u2019 urban warfare strategy, Israeli military officials said, in the face of global alarm at the staggering toll from the bombing.\n\nIsrael has dropped thousands of tonnes of munitions over the past 10 weeks, leaving the narrow Mediterranean strip in ruins and killing nearly 20,000, many under collapsed buildings, Gazan officials say. Another 50,000 are injured, with almost no healthcare facilities working.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking with reporters at the Palmachim Air Force Base, 45 km from Gaza on Monday, two officials said Israel acknowledged that the cost in civilian lives of each strike was balanced against an evaluation of the military advantage.\n\nIsrael\u2019s top war aim is to dismantle Hamas\u2019s military capabilities to prevent further attacks after the Islamist militants\u2019 Oct. 7 killings of 1,200 mainly civilian people and mass hostage-taking shook the Jewish state to its core.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the loss of life in the Palestinian enclave has eroded global support after 10 weeks of bloodshed and Israel faces escalating pressure to scale-back the offensive. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Monday urged his Israeli counterpart Israel to reduce harm to civilians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProtecting civilians in Gaza was both \u201ca moral duty and a strategic imperative\u201d, Austin said, warning excessive violence bred resentment that would benefit Hamas and make peaceful coexistence even harder in the long-term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrance, Britain and Germany on Sunday added their voices to calls for a ceasefire, while U.S. President Joe Biden last week called the bombing \u201cindiscriminate\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an example of the civilian toll in Gaza, a strike killed 19 people from two local families as they slept at home in the town of Rafah in southern Gaza on Tuesday, including women, children and two babies, Gazan health authorities said. The bomb left a deep crater and rubble where a large building had stood.\n\n\u201cWe have never seen such weapons. I was born in 1950, I have never seen anything like this,\u201d said Mohammed Zarab, whose family lost 11 people in the strike. He called it \u201ca barbarian act\u201d.\n\nAsked for comment on the strike, the IDF said it took feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm under international law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad on Sunday said Israel was \u201cindiscriminately bombing schools and tents that house hundreds of thousands of displaced people and hospitals protected by international humanitarian law\u201d.\n\nOne of the officials, a legal advisor to the Israeli Defence Forces said hospitals can become a legitimate military target when they are being used by combatants. Hamas denies operating from civilian infrastructure like hospitals or schools.\n\nDRONE BASE\n\nSpeaking alongside Austin at a news conference, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israeli forces operated legally and \u201cto minimize the harm to the civilian population\u201d.\n\nThe legal advisor said the air force was carrying out \u201cthousands and thousands of attacks and often attacks that require heavy firepower\u201d to break through tunnels.\n\n\u201cReally tragically that results in a large number of civilian casualties,\u201d said the official, in a briefing with journalists at the coastal base, from where grey military drones depart on bombing runs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Israeli military asked that the officials not be named for security reasons. Military spokesperson Daniel Hagari blamed Hamas\u2019 tactics for civilian suffering.\n\n\u201cOur intent is to defeat Hamas and secure the release of our hostages. The tragic suffering of civilians in Gaza \u2014 is not our intent.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYagil Levy, an expert in civil military relations at the Israel Open University, calculated the civilian casualty rate in the war was around 61% in October, almost double that in previous conflicts in Gaza. He said that could indicate rules of engagement being interpreted more flexibly to minimize the risk to Israeli ground forces \u201cby inflicting more death on the other side\u201d.\n\nThe officials said the government\u2019s war goal of destroying Hamas meant the campaign was more intense than in previous conflicts where the goal was to deter the group from attacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever the reason, Israel was \u201cnot winning hearts and minds\u201d, Levy said, arguing that a political alternative was the only long-term solution.\n\nBecause of the sheer number of bombs, Israel could not always warn before a strike, which was why it had turned to mass evacuations of conflict zones, the legal advisor said.\n\nMany of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people have left their homes multiple times under Israeli instructions to avoid strikes, broadcast by leaflets, on radio and social media.\n\nAnother senior Israeli military official said Israel pre-plans 90% of its daily bombing raids over Gaza. The officials said pre-planning involved a 10-step process to assess whether a target had military value, and the proportionality of the response, among other things.\n\nHagari said the military aborted attacks when it saw an unexpected civilian presence and chose which munition to use for each target to avoid unnecessary damage. Gazan authorities estimate 60% of houses have been damaged by the offensive.\n\n\u201cWe know this is hard, but we are trying to save lives,\u201d Hagari said.",

    "articleBody": "Key points\n\nOn 19 December, heavy Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea, continued across Gaza, with the most intense shelling reported in Beit Hanoun, Jabaliya, and Beit Lahiya, all in the north. Intense ground operations and fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups continued on 19 December, especially in the Middle Area and Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. The firing of rockets by Palestinian armed groups into Israel continued.\n\nOn 19 December, for the sixth day in a row, most areas of the Gaza Strip had no telecommunications or internet services severely affecting emergency operations and access to information. Services in the southern area were partially restored on 18 December.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza, between 7 October and 19 December afternoon, at least 19,667 people Palestinians have been killed in Gaza. About 70 per cent of those killed are said to be women and children. As of then, about 52,586 people have been injured, according to the MoH. Many other people are missing, presumably buried under the rubble, waiting for rescue or recovery.\n\nBetween 18 December and 19 December, three Israeli soldiers were reported killed in Gaza. Since the start of the ground operations, 132 soldiers have been killed in Gaza, and 719 soldiers have been injured, according to the Israeli military.\n\nOn 19 December, according to the World Food Programme\u2019s (WFP) Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, half of Gaza\u2019s population is starving in a situation of extreme or severe hunger, and 90 per cent of the population regularly go without food for a whole day. Only ten per cent of the food currently required for 2.2 million people has entered Gaza in the last 70 days. On 17 December, media reported people jumping onto aid trucks, attempting to secure food and other supplies.\n\nOn 18 and 19 December, multiple health facilities and personnel were attacked across the Gaza strip (see Health Care section for more details). On 18 December, Israeli forces troops reportedly raided the vicinity of Al Awda hospital in Jabalya (the north). Males over 16 years old, including medical staff, patients and internally displaced persons (IDPs) were taken out of the hospital and arrested, stripped, bound and interrogated, according to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF). While most of them were sent back into the hospital, the hospital administration and MoH reported that six people, including medical staff and the hospital director, remain in Israeli custody. The hospital was besieged for 14 days, where the 240 people inside, including 80 medical staff, 40 patients, and 120 IDPs, faced severe shortage of food, water and medicine.\n\nThe UN's Human Rights Office (OHCHR) issued a press statement on 16 December, citing reports from the north of Gaza, about mass detentions, ill-treatment, and enforced disappearances of potentially thousands of Palestinians, including children and women by the Israeli forces. Detentions occurred during the evacuations to the south of Gaza or during military operations conducted in homes, hospitals, schools, and other places sheltering IDPs in the north of Gaza. Allegations include serious ill-treatment which in some instances may amount to torture. Further reports also allege Palestinians being stripped, blindfolded, tightly handcuffed, filmed and photographed in humiliating positions. Detained people were reportedly transported to an unknown location without clothing, and with limited food, and water.\n\nOn 18 December, 60 trucks carrying supplies entered Gaza through Rafah crossing and 64 trucks entered through Kerem Shalom crossing. On 19 December, initial reports indicate that 104 trucks entered through Rafah and 60 through Kerem Shalom This is well below the daily average of 500 truckloads (including fuel and private sector goods) that entered every working day prior to 7 October.\n\nOn 18 December, 55 injured people, 56 of their accompaniers and 548 dual nationals, were evacuated from Gaza to Egypt. The total number of wounded Palestinians and other medical cases evacuated since 7 October represents one per cent of the reported injury toll.",

Having said earlier in the day that he was thinking of people \"who are suffering from war -- we are thinking of Palestine, of Israel, of Ukraine\", the pope struck a sombre tone during his Christmas Eve mass. Read More\n\nPhoto : AP\n\nPope Francis has kicked off global Christmas celebrations with a call for peace.\n\nPope Francis has kicked off global Christmas celebrations with a call for peace, as Israel's war on Hamas and Russia's invasion of Ukraine cast a shadow over one of the world's favourite holidays.\n\nHaving said earlier in the day that he was thinking of people \"who are suffering from war -- we are thinking of Palestine, of Israel, of Ukraine\", the pope struck a sombre tone during his Christmas Eve mass.\n\n\"Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,\" the pope said.\n\nThe biblical city in the occupied West Bank, where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born in a stable more than 2,000 years ago, effectively cancelled the annual Christmas celebrations that normally draw thousands of tourists.\n\nThe town did away with its giant Christmas tree, marching bands and flamboyant nativity scene this year, settling for just a few festive lights.\n\nIn the centre of town, a huge Palestinian flag had been unfolded with a banner declaring that \"The bells of Bethlehem ring for a ceasefire in Gaza\".\n\n\"A lot of people are dying for this land,\" said Nicole Najjar, an 18-year-old student.\n\n\"It's really hard to celebrate while our people are dying.\"\n\nThe Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said: \"We are here to pray and to ask not only for a ceasefire, a ceasefire is not enough, we have to stop these hostilities and to turn the page because violence generates only violence\".\n\nSister Nabila Salah from the Catholic Holy Church in Gaza -- where two Christian women were killed by an Israeli sniper earlier this month, according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem -- told AFP \"all Christmas celebrations have been cancelled\".\n\n\"How do we celebrate when we are... hearing the sound of tanks and bombardment instead of the ringing of bells?\" she said.\n\nIn Syria, churches limited celebrations to prayers in solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 left around 1,140 people dead in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest official Israeli figures.\n\nThe Palestinian militants also abducted around 250 people, 129 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.\n\nIsrael retaliated with a sustained bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, where 20,424 people have been killed, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\n- New Christmas Day -\n\nUkraine, invaded by Russia nearly two years ago, is celebrating Christmas on December 25 for the first time, jettisoning the traditional Orthodox date of January 7, which is feted in Russia, as a snub to Moscow.\n\nIn the southern Black Sea port of Odesa, churchgoers prayed and lit candles as priests in gold vestments held a Christmas Eve service in the Cathedral of the Nativity, decorated with fir trees and a nativity scene.\n\n\"We believe that we really should celebrate Christmas with the whole world, far away, far away from Moscow. For me that's the new message now,\" said one smiling parishioner, Olena, whose son is a medic on the front line.\n\nThe date change -- moving away from the Julian calendar favoured by the Orthodox Church -- is part of moves since the invasion to remove traces of the Russian and Soviet empires.\n\n- Surfing Santas -\n\nIn countries not afflicted by war, festive revellers donned Santa hats for a shot of holiday cheer -- running a city race in Skopje, North Macedonia; surfing the waves in Florida; jogging along muddy wooded paths on the outskirts of Paris; dipping in the sea near the British port of Dover; or soaking with a drink in hand in Lake Geneva.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, where the big day had already arrived, many residents and tourists headed to the beach, wearing the woolly red hats despite the heat in the Southern Hemisphere's summer.\n\nAnd children around the globe followed Santa, his reindeer and their present-laden sleigh with the help of Norad Tracks Santa, a 3-D interactive website run annually by a joint US-Canadian military monitoring agency.\n\n- Prayers in Turkey -\n\nIn southern Turkey, much of which was devastated by an earthquake in February, some faithful celebrated mass in front of the ruins of their church at Antakya.\n\n\"It's important for us to celebrate the birth of Jesus. but it's a very sad Christmas,\" said Vehbi Tadrasgil, a 55-year-old who lost his wife and two of his three children in the quake that killed at least 50,000 people in Turkey and more than 5,000 in neighbouring Syria.\n\n\"I hope that their souls are here, I am certain that our prayers rise to them,\" he said.\n\nTwenty kilometres (12 miles) down the coast in Samandag, a generator powered the lights on a tree in front of the Saint-Ilyas church, which survived.\n\n\"After the earthquake, our community -- 400 families -- was annihilated. With this Christmas, we want to wish everyone rebirth, love, joy and peace. We must move forward, rebuild a new life,\" said Father Yumurta.",

    "articleBody": "The expanding crisis\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is expanding beyond proportions with the death toll crossing 20,000 and counting, and over 50,000 injured including unprecedented numbers of ladies and children in 11 weeks, much more than what was seen in two years of the Russia-Ukraine War. With approximately 1.9 million Palestinians (about 90 per cent of Gaza\u2019s population) displaced and most dwelling units destroyed on the pretext of eradicating Hamas terrorists is too serious a human rights violation for the world to witness.\n\nIn response to the global demand for ceasefire, on 22 December 2023, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution (2720 (2023) that \u201ccalls for urgent steps to immediately allow safe, unhindered, and expanded humanitarian access and to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities\u201c. The original draft resolution \u201can urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities\u201d had to be toned down to avoid a US veto, leaving no ambiguity that the US is fully backing Israel to continue operations in Gaza to target Hamas, which is clearly violating International Humanitarian Law (IHL) on many counts. It is not only eroding the moral standing of the US and Israel on rule-based order but also indicating the helplessness of the UN system and global community to control such human catastrophe.\n\nThe overwhelming global sympathy on 7 October 2023 was deservingly with Israel after the barbaric, brutal terror attack by Hamas on civilian Israelis and foreigners and most rational minds in the world felt that a tough action by Israel to punish Hamas was morally justified. After 11 weeks, the global sympathy has shifted away from Israel backed by the US, which remains unsuccessful in justifying killing 18 times more civilian Palestinians (approximately over 20,000 in comparison to about 1,200 Israelis killed so far) as part of its right to defend itself.\n\nIn the meantime, Israel continues to expand the war in Central Gaza, as its foreign minister reiterates Israel won\u2019t stop until Hamas is eliminated and all hostages released. Hamas on the other hand reiterates no release of hostages till a permanent ceasefire is announced. The rest of the world too suffers the setback and impact of Red Sea blockage by Houthis, who continue to strike ships linked to Israel till the ceasefire.\n\nDecoding aim and strategy of Hamas\n\nThe strategy of Hamas on 7 October was to pick up a maximum number of hostages to be used as a bargaining chip later, embarrass Israel and provoke it beyond limits (by crude display of brutality), force it to respond disproportionately causing heavy casualties to innocent Palestinians in Gaza, to put the Palestinian issue from back burner to forefront, besides invoking global criticism of Israel for human right violations, which seems to have been achieved.\n\nHamas also expected favourable reaction in their support from Arab countries, radical Islamic countries and organisations, and drive a wedge in the relationship between some Arab countries and others getting closer to Israel. This has not been fully achieved as Arab countries have voiced in favour of Palestinians (not Hamas, in the context of its brutal assault on civilians) and have not intervened beyond diplomatic and moral support. Only Houthis have responded by blocking Red Sea traffic in exchange for a ceasefire and resumption of aid for Palestinians and to some extent Hezbollah has launched a few standoff attacks, which is grossly below Hamas expectations.\n\nPalestinians call 7 October brutality an ongoing step in the spiral of revenge actions against their decades-long forced subjugation and by Israeli Security Forces, which they term an \u2018Occupation Force\u2019. The future aim of Hamas will be to preserve its force and combat power. Its future strategy seems to be to hold on to hostages as long as possible (which seems to be its only insurance against the onslaught by IDF) and launch sporadic strikes to frustrate IDF, whenever possible.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s aim, strategy and criticism\n\nLooking at the Oslo Accord, Israel, as a responsible country was giving an impression (at least diplomatically) that it believed in recognising PLO/Palestinian Authority despite being in full control of the West Bank, air and maritime space of Gaza, six entry and exit points to it and inflow of essential service there, for few decades. It therefore villainise Hamas which did not recognise Israel, after helping its rise to checkmate PLO or PA in its initial stages.\n\nAfter 7 October 2023, as per Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli\u2019s stated war aim was to eradicate Hamas, ensure that its citizens are never again threatened by an attack from Gaza and ensure the release of all the hostages. He thinks that it can be done by brute military force. He also aims to prolong his political career by continuing the war, avoiding people questioning his prior lapses, due to the fog of war.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s handling of the war, use of disproportionately excessive force level and the scale of destruction caused in Gaza indicate that his undeclared strategy is to make Gaza unhabitable, force Palestinians out of Gaza, and enforce a one-state solution without declaring it as such. To minimise its casualties, IDF has opted for mass destruction and pulverising targets/buildings alleged as hideouts by standoff attacks, reducing hand-to-hand fighting in built-up areas.\n\nIDF\u2019s excuse is that Hamas is using people as human shields; hence, in such a heavy population density of Palestinians it\u2019s difficult to identify Hamas and selectively destroy it, therefore the use of airpower, 2,000-pound bombs, (capable of killing/wounding people more than 1,000 feet away and resultant collateral damages) are necessary, doesn\u2019t justify the use of area weapons designed for mass casualties and killing of over 8,000 children. Blaming Artificial Intelligence tools for civilian casualties is as absurd as blaming high-tech fencing for conceding Hamas attack. The Israeli strategy of weaponising the survival needs of Palestinians might add to a new definition of state terrorism if the world community ever manages to define it.\n\nA critical analysis reveals that Netanyahu\u2019s response to the 07/10 attack is guided by vengeance and revenge for the loss of reputation, which he and Israel suffered, instead of a well-thought-out strategy, expected from a professional military force. His selection of strategic aims was overambitious; hence none of them was achieved in 11 weeks, despite heavy civilian casualties, unlike Israel\u2019s successful conclusion of the war in six days in 1967 and 19 days in the Yom Kippur War in past. No Hamas fighter has surrendered and the sporadic attacks by Hamas and PIJ in Israel are continuing. The only release of hostages secured so far has been through negotiations and not by any successful military rescue operation by IDF so far.\n\nIsrael under a frustrated Netanyahu is not willing to accept a ceasefire with approximately 120 hostages still in the captivity of Hamas. Netanyahu is under tremendous domestic pressure spearheaded by relatives of hostages, more so after the fratricide of three Israeli hostages, highlighting uncontrolled firing by its soldiers. Other than hardliners under Netanyahu, many Israelis feel that the chances of getting hostages alive through negotiations are higher than by IDF terrorising Palestinians with indiscriminate firing and expecting them to generate pressure on Hamas to surrender and release prisoners. Netanyahu and IDF feel that a ceasefire can disrupt the eradication of Hamas and its infrastructure and handicap them with the lost opportunity of enforcing One state (Greater Israel) making Two State solution absolutely impractical for the future.\n\nHamas is an ideology, brewed out of the subjugation of the population confined into the bounds of Gaza. With growing hatred towards Israel due to unprecedented casualties, the ideology is unlikely to die down. Moreover, many Hamas leaders are outside Gaza, away from striking distance of Israel, will survive the destruction of Gaza. While Israel may be able to comb Gaza, due to the large asymmetry of military assets in its favour, backed by US\\ to reduce the striking capability of Hamas, in the long term it will make itself and its people more insecure to terror attacks within and outside Israel, as the US Defence Secretary rightly warns Israel that failure to protect Palestinian civilians could lead to \u2018strategic defeat\u2019.\n\nDiscomfort of US\n\nThe United States finds itself in a difficult spot in context of supporting Israel to continue the war. It cannot leave Israel halfway in the destruction of Hamas, which can bounce back to strike Israel again. Israel is strategically very important to the US being its strongest ally and the most dependable stronghold in the Middle East. With shrinking footprints in the Middle East, it has become a strategic compulsion for the US to support Israel to hold on to its pivot there.\n\nUS has adopted a policy of providing diplomatic, military, financial and moral support to Israel, at the same time making statements to favour humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza. It is felt that US has sufficient leverage to force Israel to accept a ceasefire and follow the path of negotiation, but it seems convinced that Israel needs to be given more time to destroy the infrastructure of Hamas. Its calls for protecting and aiding civilians in Gaza look like mere optics to reduce its collateral damages in its international relations and Presidential elections. Israel doesn\u2019t seem to be taking its advice of shifting to lower-intensity operations to save casualties seriously, as civilian casualties are mounting despite US advisories.\n\nUS is also coming under tremendous pressure from its other allies and partners on losing moral ground in failing to check Israel to prevent mass casualties of women and children. President Joe Biden is also worried about the political cost of losing the support of a large segment of the pro-Palestinian population in a pre-election year. The US\u2019s role as a proponent of rule-based order is under threat by standing with Israel, accused of violating IHL in Gaza daily with the US as an accomplice.\n\nPost-war Gaza\n\nIsrael\u2019s stands alone in its post-war plans for Gaza, which are at variance with US, its allies, UN and world community. It is planning to have a buffer zone or a security envelope along the Gaza border, however, its statements reveal that it has the intention of permanent presence of IDF in Gaza, and looks at Gaza without Hamas as an end state, notwithstanding the democratic will of Palestinians, which has seen a sharp rise in favour of Hamas.\n\nIts closest ally US is insisting on a two-state solution, which has laid down five principles for the future of Gaza, its vice-president said \u201cNo forcible displacement of the Palestinian people, no reoccupation of Gaza, no siege or blockade, no reduction in territory, and no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism\u201d.\n\nPalestinian Authority (PA) led by Mahmoud Abbas may be keen to takeover Gaza, but it has own drawbacks due to lack of credibility of PA leaders, who haven\u2019t had elections after 2005 and do not represent the people of Gaza. Governance under UN stabilisation Mission till elections are held, could be an option, only if Israel as well as Palestinians agree for it, which seems difficult.\n\nFallout in Red Sea\n\nVarious drone/missile attacks, offensive acts by Houthis on all shipping vessels connected to Israel, till ceasefire is implemented in Gaza, is choking one of the busiest maritime trade route, which impacts global trade. Shipping companies have started taking longer routes around South Africa, increasing the cost of transshipment, which is impacting the cost of oil and other commodities being shipped through Red Sea.\n\nThe US led Operation Prosperity Guardian to build Red Sea coalition for joint protection of shipping may have been signed by 20 countries, but its showing signs of weak coalition, as none of the Red Sea countries except Bahrain is part of it. Few of US allies have agreed for token presence, without putting their ship under US. The counter argument against this US initiative is that instead of expanding war in Red Sea, if US pressurises Israel for ceasefire in Gaza, there will be no threat to Red Sea and no need for Red Sea coalition.\n\nWay ahead\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s strategy to seek pure military solution to the crisis in Gaza is ill conceived and his frustration of neither being able to ensure security of its people, nor getting the hostages released is not going to take him too far but caught in crossfire are over two million Palestinians and 120 hostages, who can never forget these days of living under terror. Hamas terror is brutal and barbaric and must be punished with right strategy with people centric approach and conventional surgical COIN operations, without using area weapons like airstrikes and bombs to minimise collateral damage.\n\nWith current strategy, IDF might prevail in destroying Gaza with harsh punishment to all its occupants, the complete destruction of Hamas and its ideology is not possible. The excessive civilian casualties inflicted can give adequate reason for developing next generation of Hamas terrorists, even if the current one is defeated. Already the number of ladies and children, journalists and UN Staff killed in over two months has exceeded two years of Russia=Ukraine War, inviting global criticism and isolation for Israel as well as US.\n\nFor Palestinians, the poor leadership of Abbas, whose term expired 12 years ago and with radicalised, brutal Hamas, the promise of peace and its legitimate rights looks bleak, notwithstanding genuineness of their cause and optics of support by Arab world. The current war is heading towards long term insurgency with more Palestinian revenge seekers and insecure Israelis within and outside the country. The threat in Red Sea will impact global shipping and economy for few months at least. This major distraction for US, much to the advantage of Russia and China may well be a turning point in long term decline of US and Israel.\n\nThe author is an international strategic and military analyst, well versed with the area of conflict, as former UN Peacekeeper.

    "articleBody": "Tel Aviv [Israel], December 24 (ANI): The decades old Israel-Palestine issue has been a matter that has kept the world divided at large. Although almost all major nations have advocated for a two-state solution, it was never other than the Oslo Accords (1993), that the two parties ever came close to any agreement.\n\nThe ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict has considerably dimmed prospects for a near-future resolution between Israel and Palestine as Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, \"I won't allow 'Hamastan' to turn into 'Fatahstan' even if this is the wish of Israel's staunchest ally\".\n\nTwenty years after Oslo Accord, Hamas launched an attack on October 7, 2023 on Israel and IDF replied it by a strong counteroffensive and bombardment of Gaza. The manner in which this Israel-Hamas war is progressing, it has pushed the chances of the two sides reaching an agreement in any foreseeable future.\n\nOctober 7 attacks\n\nIt was the Jewish festival of Sukkot. The whole of Israel was having a sound sleep when over 2000 Hamas terrorists breached the borders and started a brutal massacre, killing and raping innocent civilians. Emerging videos showed extremely horrific visuals from Israel. More than 1200 people including some foreigners, were killed and over 240 people were held as hostages by Hamas.\n\nAfter the attacks, Netanyahu in a strong statement said that the country is at 'war' with the \"enemy\" and will come out victorious. He also vowed to turn all Hamas outfits in Gaza into \"rubble\".\n\n\"All of the places which Hamas is deployed, hiding and operating in, that wicked city, we will turn them into rubble,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe October 7 attack came as a severe blow to the robust Israeli intelligence and security system. In response, Israel launched a strong counteroffensive against the Hamas terror units in Gaza.\n\nCountries including India, condemned the attack and expressed full support and solidarity with Israel. However, with time as Israeli attacks and bombardments led to mounting civilian death toll and visuals showing the deplorable humanitarian condition in Gaza, Tel Aviv has also received global criticism. According to the Gaza health ministry, over 20,000 people including 8000 children have been killed in Gaza in Israeli strikes.\n\nIn the month of December, in a truce brokered by Qatar, Israel and Hamas reached an agreement for a pause in fighting, alongside the release in which over 100 hostages (both Israeli and foreign nationals) were released from Hamas captivity. Israel also released around 240 Palestinian prisoners including children during the deal, CNN reported.\n\nHowever, the deal was short-lived, and subsequent accusations of truce violations prolonged the conflict, with around 130 hostages still in Hamas captivity, while the US and other countries continue to manage another hostage deal.\n\nTiming of the attack\n\nThere have been many speculations regarding Hamas choosing this particular time for attacking Israel. Israel has throughout maintained that there was an \"Iranian hand\" behind the attack. It has also accused Tehran of pumping billions of dollars to continue the \"terror machine\" of Hamas. According to Tel Aviv, and as also pointed out by several experts, both Hamas and Iran were irked by Israel's growing acceptance by the Arab world.\n\n\"And the real umpire of evil here starts in Tehran and spreads Islamic fundamentalism of the worst kind to the entire region,\" Israel President Herzog told ANI in November.\n\nEarlier in March, China brokered a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia -- two arch-rivals -- which was considered a major breakthrough after seven years of severed diplomatic relations. The two countries agreed to reestablish diplomatic ties after seven years of hostility, CNN reported.\n\nIn another breakthrough, Israel and Saudi Arabia were close to reaching an agreement, CNN reported. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that his country was moving steadily in the direction of normalizing relations with Israel, the latter of which was also eager for the same.\n\nIn another development, the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) that was announced during the sidelines of the G20 Summit in India was seen as a major inclusive moment of Israel with the Arab world.\n\nIsrael has alleged that it was because of this, that Iran and Hamas both wanted to derail the process.\n\n\"But somebody decided they wanted to derail this effort of inclusion of Israel and this huge peace vision of President Biden...this empire of evil Iran, who is working extra hours to undermine any inclusion of Israel in the region and any peace process,\" Herzog said.\n\nOslo Accords\n\nIt is considered that during Oslo Accords in 1993 was the moment when the Israel-Palestinian conflict neared a solution. The two sides agreed to a \"declaration of principles,\" known as the Oslo Accord, which set the terms for further peace negotiations, with the promise of a permanent resolution within five years, the New York Times reported.\n\nAs per the treaty brokered by then-Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) chief Yasser Arafat, both Israel and PLO finally recognised each other. It also called defined areas under control of Israel, Palestine and some under joint control till further negotiations.\n\nHowever, this deal suffered a massive setback after PM Rabin was assassinated by extremists who were outraged over this deal.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu, who is also leading the country now has throughout been a staunch opposer of the Oslo Accords and any settlement with Palestinian state. Netanyahu has also said that he is indeed \"proud\" of preventing the Palestinian state, Times of Israel reported.\n\nOver the years, Israeli settlements have increased in the West Bank further worsening the conflict.\n\nFuture of Gaza and Israel-Palestine conflict\n\nAs the war has continued to ravage, a question has been pondered continuously regarding who will be governing Gaza once this war ends. While, the US and President Joe Biden himself, have multiple times said that Gaza will come under PLO control, Israel has not agreed. Publicly differing from Washington's stand, Israel and PM Netanyahu have throughout said that PLO \"can't be trusted\" and Gaza will be controlled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) after the war.\n\n\"I said there will be demilitarisation. I said the IDF will be responsible for security in the Gaza Strip because there is no other factor that will ensure the fight against terrorism. And I can tell you that there will be a civil government that does not educate its children to destroy Israel,\" Netanyahu said in a briefing last week.\n\nReferring to the US, he added, \"I won't allow 'Hamastan' to turn into 'Fatahstan' even if this is the wish of Israel's staunchest ally\".\n\n\"I inherited the Oslo Accords...I'm proud that I prevented the establishment of a Palestinian state because today everybody understands what that Palestine state could have been, now that we've seen the little Palestinian state in Gaza,\" Times of Israel quoted him as saying.\n\nThe strong remarks by Netanyahu have made sure that any settlement between Israel and Palestine in line with the Oslo Accords is not on Tel Aviv's cards at least in the near future.\n\nThese attacks have left a strong scar on Israel making it further insecure of having a Palestinian state nearby. A survey showed that 82 per cent of people in the PLO-controlled West Bank supported the October 7 attacks. There have been many reports showing how Palestinian youth are getting more radicalised against Israel.\n\nSuch trends further worsen the prospects of the two sides reaching any agreement in the near future. But, while Israel and the PLO or Hamas continue to be at loggerheads, it is the innocent civilians of both sides, whose future actually lies in grave uncertainty amid the continuous conflict.

    "articleBody": "How does women tears reduce aggression of men? (image by Drazen zigic on freepik)\n\nImpact of Women Tears on Men's Aggression - Israeli Institute's Study Gives Surprising Results\n\nBy Aroop Pandit\n\nFollow Us Share\n\nThe Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel recently conducted research aimed at studying the impact of women tears on male aggression.\n\nThis study discussed the chemical composition of tears and its impact on someone\u2019s aggressive behavior, investigating its work mechanism that resembles social chemosignaling, typically found in animals.\n\nThe research, published in the open-access journal PLOS Biology, was led by Shani Agron who put some light on the social chemosignaling facet that is present in animals. In this article, we will explore more on the study done on the effect of women's tears on male aggression.\n\nResearch about women tears and its key insights\n\nWomen's tears contain chemicals that can reduce men\u2019s aggression (image by Anthony Tran on unsplash)\n\nTrending\n\nThe research was conducted at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and it was led by Shani Agron who found that women tears tend to reduce the aggression of men.\n\nThe apparent reason behind this is the combination by which tears are made. The composition of women tears and their effect on humans is very similar to the concept of social chemosignaling which is found in animals, especially rodents; it means that the aggression shown by men can fade away to an extent due to women tears.\n\nAgron said (h/t Weizmann-usa.org):\n\n\u201cWe knew that sniffing tears lowers testosterone and that lowering testosterone has a greater effect on aggression in men than in women, so we began by studying the impact of tears on men because this gave us higher chances of seeing an effect.\u201d\n\nTo find out if something similar to chemosignaling exists in the human body as rodents, Agron's team collected women tears by making them watch sad movies. 25 men participated in the study and were asked to play a two-person monetary game where the other player was a computer algorithm, of which the participants were unaware.\n\nThey did this to make the participants angry as they were told that the opponent was cheating. Before starting the game, participants were asked to sniff mixtures that either contained women tears or saline. Both contained no odor or color and the participants were unaware of the composition of the solution.\n\nThe outcome of the test performed was as follows:\n\n1. Men who sniffed women's tears showed a reduction by 40% in aggressive behavior in a two-person monetary game. This reduction in aggression shows a strong effect of women's tears on a man\u2019s behavior.\n\n2. The readings of the brain explained reduction in two specific regions of the brain that are linked to aggression i.e. the prefrontal cortex and the anterior insula when men were exposed to women's tears.\n\n3. The decrease in brain activity is connected with the reduction in behavior of revenge-seeking, which ultimately shows the correlation between tears, brain activity, and aggression.\n\n4. This research proves that chemosignaling affects aggression in humans contradicting the belief that it is only present in animals. The chemical signals produced by women's tears share the same work mechanism among mammals.\n\nImplications of chemosignaling\n\nChemosignaling is mostly seen in animals (Image by dcstudio on freepik)\n\nThe study observed a chemical signal present in women's tears that acts as a potential regulator for aggression in males. This contradicts the statement that sorrowful tears are individually an expressive trait and indicate their function in personal situations.\n\nThe connection between tears, brain activity, and aggression contributes to a better understanding of the work mechanisms of human emotions. The link between olfaction and brain regions related to aggression shows a different influence between sensory perception and social behavior.\n\nThese observations unlock new aspects to discuss like real-life applications of chemosignaling due to women's tears.\n\nThe study implicated that women's tears induce chemicals that can reduce men\u2019s aggression by 40%. It has been believed that chemosignaling, at first, was only present in animals but by this research, it has now been proven, to an extent, that it is present in mammals too.",

While those who exercise power seek to take their place with the great ones of history, the King of history chooses the way of littleness.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of the powerful take notice of him,\u201d the Pope stressed: \u201cOnly a few shepherds, relegated to the margins of social life.\u201d\n\nIncarnation, not achievement\n\nThe emperor\u2019s \u201ccensus of the whole earth\u201d, Pope Francis said, thus \u201cmanifests the all-too-human thread that runs through history: the quest for worldly power and might, fame and glory, which measures everything in terms of success, results, numbers and figures, a world obsessed with achievement.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, an alternative to this approach. Jesus, the Pope suggested, is \u201cnot the god of accomplishment, but the God of Incarnation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does not eliminate injustice from above by a show of power,\u201d Pope Francis stressed, \u201cbut from below, by a show of love. He does not burst on the scene with limitless power, but descends to the narrow confines of our lives.\u201d\n\nIn his greatness, he became small\n\nLet us, then, Pope Francis urged, keep our eyes fixed on this \u201cliving and true God.\u201d\n\nHe is, the Pope said, the God who \u201crevolutionizes history by becoming a part of history\u201d, and the God who \u201cso respects us as to allow us to reject him; who takes away sin by taking it upon himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod so greatly desires to embrace our lives\u201d, the Pope added, that \u201cinfinite though he is, he becomes finite for our sake. In his greatness, he chooses to become small; in his righteousness, he submits to our injustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Pope Francis stressed, \u201cis the wonder of Christmas\u201d.\n\nWar in the Holy Land\n\nThe Pope\u2019s thoughts also turned to the Holy Land, currently suffering from the Israel-Palestine conflict, and in particular to Bethlehem, the city of Jesus\u2019 birth.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d he said, \u201cour hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world.\n\nPope Francis brought his homily to a close with a prayer.",

    "articleBody": "The IDF on Sunday night disclosed the full background behind the finding of five bodies of hostages held by Hamas in a huge underground tunnel near Jabalya in northern Gaza.\n\nAround two weeks ago, the IDF found two bodies. A few days later, it found three more nearby. At the time, the military announced finding only the first two.\n\nThe tunnel was vast, including a large elevator and large rooms, and split into side rooms, like command centers, medical stations, prayer rooms, and rooms for manufacturing weapons.\n\nThe IDF destroys Hamas underground infrastructure near Jabalya, Gaza City (IDF SPOKESPERSON'S UNIT)\n\nAn IDF source has said that finding the bodies required a mix of preexisting intelligence along with intelligence collected in real time in the field, including through forensic methods. Advertisement\n\nThe tunnel was so large, that although the bodies were all within one general area, they were all in different parts of it.\n\nThe five were Eden Zechariah and Ziv Dado, whose bodies were found on December 12, as well as Elia Toledano, Nik Beizer, and Ron Sherman. Advertisement Israeli hostages Nik Beizer, Ron Sherman, Elia Toledano, whose bodies were brought back to Israel, December 15, 2023 (credit: JERUSALEM POST)\n\nLast Thursday, Hamas released a video of the other three hostages killed in Hamas captivity, whose bodies the IDF had recovered.\n\nIn the video, the three hostages \u2013 Toledano, Beizer, and Sherman, are seen holding up pieces of paper with their names and personal information. All three were kidnapped on October 7.\n\nIn a statement posted alongside the video, Hamas claimed that \u201cthey tried to keep them alive, but Netanyahu insisted on killing them.\u201d Advertisement\n\nThe video then adds visual effects of shots and animated blood. They are shown in captivity smiling and speaking to each other.\n\nIDF concerned over endangering forces on field\n\nThe IDF said it delayed mentioning the other three bodies until troops in the area completed their operations. Until then, there was real concern that announcing more details would endanger the forces in the field, who eventually used 13 tons of explosives to blow up the whole tunnel, something that took more time.\n\nIn addition, whereas the IDF had said that Zechariah was killed back on October 7 and merely her body was taken to Gaza, the IDF did not give a clear conclusion about the timing of the deaths of the other hostages.

The Israeli military spokesperson's office said it was looking into the report.\n\nIsrael reported the highest two-day death toll for its troops in more than a month.\n\nThe head of the Islamic Jihad militant group joined talks in Cairo, one small sign at least that diplomacy remained alive.\n\nBut in Bethlehem, the Israeli-occupied Palestinian West Bank city where Jesus Christ is believed to have been born in a stable 2,000 years ago, clergy cancelled traditional celebrations for the first time in memory.\n\n\"Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,\" Pope Francis said, presiding at Christmas Eve Mass in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n\nPalestinian Christians earlier held a Christmas vigil in Bethlehem with candle-lit hymns and prayers for peace in Gaza instead of the usual celebrations.\n\nThere was no large tree, the usual centrepiece of Bethlehem's Christmas celebrations. Nativity figurines in churches were placed amid rubble and barbed wire in solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nIn the latest massive airstrike, health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said at least 70 Palestinians were killed and several houses damaged in central Gaza's Maghazi area on Sunday night. He said many were women and children.\n\nSince a week-long truce collapsed at the start of the month, fighting has only intensified on the ground, with war spreading from the north of the Gaza Strip to the full length of the enclave.\n\n\n\n\n\n'DIFFICULT DAY'\n\nThe Israeli military said 10 of its soldiers had been killed in the past day, following five killed the previous day, its worst two-day losses since early November.\n\n\"This is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday. \"The war is exacting a very heavy cost from us; however we have no choice (but) to continue to fight.\"\n\nIn a later video message he said troops would fight on deeper into Gaza until \"total victory\" over Hamas, adding: \"We are doing everything to safeguard the lives of our warriors.\"\n\nIsrael has been under intensifying pressure in recent weeks from its closest ally the United States to scale down its military campaign and reduce civilian deaths.\n\nThe Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but blames Hamas for operating in densely populated areas or using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\n\nOn Friday, Washington withheld its veto from a U.N. Security Council resolution on the war, allowing the measure to pass after language calling for an immediate halt to hostilities was watered down.\n\nSeparate diplomatic efforts, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, on a new truce to free remaining hostages held by militants in Gaza have yielded little public progress, although Washington described the talks last week as \"very serious\".\n\nIslamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied to Hamas, said a delegation led by its exiled leader Ziad al-Nakhlala was in Cairo on Sunday. His arrival followed talks attended by Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in recent days.\n\nThe militant groups have so far said they will not discuss any release of hostages unless Israel ends its war in Gaza, while the Israelis say they are willing to discuss only a temporary pause in fighting.\n\nThe Cairo talks would centre on \"ways to end the Israeli aggression on our people\", said an Islamic Jihad official.\n\nThe delegation would reaffirm the group's position that any exchange of hostages will have to secure the release of all Palestinians jailed in Israel, \"after a ceasefire is achieved\", the official said.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad, both sworn to Israel's destruction, are still believed to be holding more than 100 hostages from among 240 they captured during their Oct. 7 rampage through Israeli towns, when they killed 1,200 people.\n\nSince then, Israel has besieged the Gaza Strip and laid much of it to waste, with more than 20,400 people confirmed killed, according to authorities in Hamas-ruled Gaza, and thousands more are believed dead under the rubble. The vast majority of the 2.3 million Gazans have been driven from their homes and the United Nations says conditions are catastrophic.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel's military chief of staff said his forces had largely achieved operational control in the north of Gaza and would expand operations further in the south.\n\nBut residents say fighting has only intensified in northern districts, notably Jabalia which Israeli forces were pounding with air strikes overnight and into Sunday. Tanks had moved further into the town on Saturday.\n\nIn the central part of the Gaza Strip, medics said six Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Bureij, where the Israeli army ordered people to evacuate and head west towards Deir Al-Balah city.\n\nJoudat Imad, 55, a father-of-six, had to leave an area in Nusseirat in central Gaza after a map published by the army marked it as a place people had to evacuate.\n\n\"I was lucky to get a tent in Rafah,\" he told Reuters by phone. \"From an owner of two buildings to a refugee in a tent awaiting aid - that is what this brutal war has turned us to. The world is sick and inhumane that it can't see Israel's brutality and it is helpless to stop this war of destruction and starvation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael and Hamas at war https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/ GRAPHIC-Mapping the conflict in Israel and Gaza https://www.reuters.com/graphics/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS/MAPS/movajdladpa/#bombardment-in-gaza-intensifies INSIGHT-The fight to keep counting the dead in Gaza nL8N3DF2FL FACTBOX-Shipping firms avoid Red Sea as Houthi attacks increase nL1N3DE06U Gaza war 'most dangerous ever' for journalists, says rights group nL8N3DG5BC Israelis dig in for unprecedentedly long war, with some doubts nL8N3DH2D4\n\n\n\nReporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza, Dan Williams in Jerusalem; Additional reporting by Philip Pullella in Rome Bassam Masoud in Gaza, Michelle Nichols at the United Nations, Dan Williams in Jerusalem and Nafisa Eltahir in Cairo and Trevor Hunnicutt and Humeyra Pamuk in Washington; Writing by Peter Graff; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman, Alex Richardson and Howard Goller",

    "articleBody": "Zionism is one of the more popular movements Judaism has ever experienced. There are over six million Jews living in Israel and while not every one of them would describe themselves as such, the overwhelming majority of Israeli Jews would call themselves Zionists.\n\nThe Zionist movement wasn\u2019t always as popular as it is today. In its inception and for its first 50-75 years, most Jews and non-Jews around the world objected to the Zionist movement. In the face of overwhelming rejection, Zionist leaders were convinced their goals were correct and they kept fighting to secure a Jewish State in the land of Israel.\n\nA recent PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll showed that six out of 10 Americans feel that Israel should receive more funding from the United States. Americans are more likely to sympathize with the Israelis (61%) than the Palestinians (30%). Republicans (79%) and independents (67%) express greater sympathy toward Israel than toward Palestinians. Democrats are divided, with 45% saying they have greater sympathy for Israelis, and the same proportion (45%) saying that their sympathies are more with the Palestinians.\n\nWhile those poll results are encouraging, they don\u2019t tell the entire story. Thirty-eight percent of Americans say Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas has been too much. This is up from 26% in the week following the October attack. Seventeen percent say the response has been too little, a decline from 27% \u2013 and 38% think the attack has been appropriate. This is down from 44% previously. It seems that Americans feel Israel has a right to defend itself but disagree about how Israel is defending itself. Advertisement Bernie Sanders responds to a question from a reporter (credit: LUCAS JACKSON / REUTERS)\n\nLegitimate questions about how Israel is conducting the war against Palestinian terrorists, including Hamas, are being asked. US Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont wrote, \u201cIsrael is at war with Hamas, not innocent Palestinian men, women, and children. Israel cannot bomb an entire neighborhood to take out one Hamas target. We don\u2019t know if this campaign has been effective in degrading Hamas\u2019s military capabilities. But we do know that a reported 70 percent of the casualties are women and children, and that 104 UN aid workers and 53 journalists have been killed. That\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d\n\nRisk of driving Gaza\u2019s population into the arms of Hamas\n\nThe American military leaders have a different concern. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin claimed that Israel\u2019s counteroffensive was risking driving Gaza\u2019s population into the arms of the enemy. Secretary Austin warned that Israel\u2019s defeat of Gaza combined with thousands of civilian casualties risked turning a tactical victory into a strategic defeat. Advertisement\n\nAsked whether he is concerned that the rapidly climbing non-combatant death toll in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas will lead Palestinian civilians to turn to terror, US Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Charles Q. Brown responded, \u201cYes, very much so. I think that\u2019s something we must pay attention to. That\u2019s why when we talk about time \u2013 the faster you can get to a point where you stop the hostilities, you have less strife for the civilian population that turns into someone who now wants to be the next member of Hamas.\u201d\n\nThere are two wars being fought in Gaza and Israel today. The first is the war on the streets of Gaza. This is a battle Hamas and other Palestinians started with their attack on Simchat Torah \u2013 October 7. This is a brutal war with many far-reaching ramifications. The deaths of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians are a tragic result of this war. The second war being fought is in courtrooms of public opinion. The war of words is fought in mainstream media, social media, and in college classrooms. Israel is winning the first war, and it seems the Palestinians and their Iranian backers are winning the second war.\n\nThese two wars aren\u2019t as separate as they might seem. Israel is being judged on the world stage and will be severely sanctioned if it continues waging war without global support. How much should Israel concern itself with the second war, the one of public opinion? Advertisement\n\nEarly Zionists showed modern Israel, their descendants, that public perception should only be taken into account until it begins making your values impossible to uphold, and your objectives impossible to achieve. They learned this lesson from the Maccabees in the Hanukkah story. Instead of bending to the opinion of the majority of the world, and to Jews who had assimilated into Greeks, they stood up and fought off their enemy.\n\nOf the two wars Israel is currently fighting, the priority must be the war in the streets of Gaza against Hamas terrorists. The Palestinian terrorists pose a threat to Israel\u2019s way of life. If they are allowed to continue and live on past this war, Israel will be opening itself up to further attacks like the one it saw on Simchat Torah. To quote Senator Sanders when he discussed Israeli battle practices, \u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d\n\nIsrael has a responsibility to its own citizens and soldiers to use airstrikes that cause more damage to the streets and homes of the enemy than to send in ground forces to wipe out the enemy. While ground forces limit the number of civilian casualties on the enemy side, they increase the number of casualties among Israeli soldiers. While there are those who argue that Israel has a responsibility to put its own soldiers at risk to limit civilian casualties, those arguments aren\u2019t widely accepted, especially not in Israel.\n\nWhile public perception is important, Israel isn\u2019t going to sacrifice its soldiers\u2019 lives, or future civilian lives to appease people marching against its existence in the streets of Europe or to gain more Facebook or Instagram likes or reposted Tweets. War isn\u2019t a numbers game. War is fought to win safety for your people.\n\nThe self-interest and safety of the Jewish people is where Israel\u2019s Zionist founders set an example of where the Jewish state should focus.\n\nThe writer, a rabbi, is CEO of Israel Educational Supply.",

The ship is believed to have carried crude from Saudi Arabia.\n\nMeanwhile on Saturday, an Indian-flagged crude oil tanker was similarly attacked in the Red Sea by a drone fired by Iran-backed Houthi terrorists. However, no injuries were reported in the Gabon-owned MV Saibaba.\n\nThe recent attacks are part of a series of strikes launched by the Houthi terror group in response to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIran has withstood criticism from not just US but also from UK where the country\u2019s Foreign Secretary David Cameron branded Iran a \"malign influence in the region and the world.\"\n\nKanaani, on the other hand, has slammed Cameron for being \u201crepetitive\u201d and \u201cthreadbare.\u201d\n\nIn order to avoid persistent Houthi and Yemeni rebels\u2019 attacks in the Red Sea, major shipping firms have decided to reroute their vessels to pass through the southern tip of Africa which is a much longer voyage.",

Labuschagne has been permitted to use the sticker in international cricket without any issues.\n\n\"We really support Uzzy. He's standing up for what he believes and I think he's done it really respectfully,\" Cummins told reporters on the eve of the second Test at the MCG.\n\n\"As I said last week, 'All lives are equal', I don't think that's very offensive and I'd say the same about the dove.\"\n\nBacking his 37-year-old colleague who was born in Pakistan capital Islamabad, Cummins added, \"That's Uzzy. I think he can really hold his head high with the way he's gone about it.\n\n\"But obviously there's rules in place and I believe the ICC have said they're not going to approve that. They make up the rules and you've got to accept it.\"\n\nKhawaja's recent actions follow an ICC reprimand for wearing a black armband during Australia's victory over Pakistan in Perth. Previously, he was barred from wearing boots with messages related to the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\n\"When I'm looking at my Instagram and seeing innocent kids, videos of them dying, passing away, that's what hit me the hardest,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't have any agendas other than trying to shine a light on what I feel really passionately, really strongly about.\"\n\nInputs from PTI",

Ten of the soldiers were killed on Saturday.\n\nOn Monday morning, the IDF announced the death of two additional soldiers in fighting Sunday evening. The number of soldiers killed since the ground invasion now stands at 158.\n\nMonday morning, Gaza Health officials said that over 100 people had been killed in Israeli strikes in Deir al-Balah and in the refugee camps of al-Maghazi, al-Bureij, and Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip. The IDF said it was investigating the claims but also highlighted significant \u201cchallenges posed by Hamas terrorists operating in civilian areas in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe IDF said it \u201cis bound by international law and takes steps to minimize harm to civilians.\u201d\n\nIsrael announced the killing of another Hamas commander Monday morning, during combined operations in the Khan Younis neighborhood of southern Gaza. The IDF estimates that it has killed about 8,000 Hamas terrorists since the beginning of the war.\n\nSoldiers also found a large cache of weapons in Beit Lahia, including many Kalashnikov rifles, IEDs, and magazines with ammunition.\n\nThe IDF is encountering increasing resistance from Hamas as it operates in Khan Younis and the southern Gaza Strip, where many Hamas leaders are believed to be hiding. Some defense officials have said that the IDF will have to begin operating in the Philadelphia corridor near the Rafah border crossing, as there is an increasing suspicion that Hamas leaders may try to flee into Egypt through tunnels under the border crossing.\n\nOn Sunday, Israel also announced the destruction of a large tunnel system in the northern Gaza Strip in Jabaliya. The IDF found the bodies of five hostages in the tunnel network earlier this month.\n\nThree of the bodies belonged to IDF soldiers and two were civilians. The bodies were found in two different areas of the tunnel network.\n\nSoldiers from the Yahalom combat engineering unit were involved in mapping and destroying the tunnel system, which spread over an area of around one square kilometer. The tunnel system contained two different levels and connected a school, a hospital, and the home of the former commander of the northern Gaza brigade, Ahmed Ghandour, who was killed earlier in the war.\n\nSoldiers also found detention rooms, weapons manufacturing equipment, and military headquarters within the tunnels.\n\nThe IDF is also reportedly surprised at the amount of military infrastructure it is finding in southern Gaza, both in terror tunnels, and within civilian buildings. The findings indicate that Hamas has been preparing for the conflict for some time.\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, the IDF anticipates fighting in the Gaza Strip could last several more months. The IDF believes that Hamas leadership and the remaining hostages are in the tunnel system in the southern Gaza Strip, which is more extensive than in the northern Gaza Strip.",

PPP does not believe in political vendettas and does not wish to engage in such practices with its opponents. However, the cipher incident is a matter of grave concern and should be thoroughly investigated. It poses a significant breach of national security,\u201d the PPP chairman said while speaking to the media in Larkana.\n\nBilawal asserted that there is no record of cipher given to Imran who himself had admitted that it was misplaced. However, he added that it became a subject of global media attention on the day the PTI founder was arrested.\n\nRead Sher Afzal Marwat to run for NA-32 Peshawar\n\nBilawal called for a serious approach from the judiciary or a government-led inquiry to unveil the story behind the cypher matter.\n\nIn response to a question about the electoral alliance, Bilawal stated that objections can be raised against any leader, but any political worker of any party, including PTI, should have the freedom to engage in politics.\n\nThe former foreign minister quipped, \"Nawaz Sharif's initial slogan was, \"Why was I ousted?\" In this election, his slogan will be, 'Why was I invited?'\"\n\nCommenting on the PPP's recent coalition government with the PML-N and the party's long march which was staged to oust Imran Khan from the government, he claimed that he has learned from his mistake.\n\n\"There is a saying in English, if you fool me once then shame on you and if you fool me twice then shame on me.\"\n\nResponding to a question he admitted his inability to deny two seats of legislators to a single political family, expressing his wish that one day he may be able to do that.\n\nHe reiterated that though he did not believe in political victimisation, which his party and family had also suffered, he wanted the judiciary to seriously conduct the trial of that case.\n\n\u0644\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u0648: \u0686\u06cc\u0626\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0632\u067e\u0627\u0631\u0679\u06cc \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u06be\u0679\u0648 \u0632\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0644\u0627\u0691\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u06c1 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0645\u06cc\u0688\u06cc\u0627 \u0633\u06d2 \u06af\u0641\u062a\u06af\u0648 \u06a9\u0631\u0631\u06c1\u06d2 \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba. https://t.co/GAvQUS1Q2e \u2014 Pakistan Peoples Party - PPP (@PPP_Org) December 24, 2023\n\nMuch as he criticised the PTI's founding leader, Bilawal held out an olive branch to the PTI's workers to join forces with the PPP.\n\n\"Differences of opinion may exist against some political leaders, but we respect workers of all political parties and we invite them to join the PPP to do politics.\"\n\nThe PPP's leader said he envisioned building three million houses across the country for the poor people and to give ownership of those houses to the female family members.\n\nHe added that 70% of the country's population comprised youth for whom the PPP wanted to create employment opportunities.\n\n\"Our contest isn't against any political party or any political leader but we are fighting against unemployment, poverty, economic crisis and inflation.\"\n\nBilawal is contesting from two constituencies of the national assembly from the neighbouring districts, Larkana and Qambar-Shahdadkot. NA-194 Larkana and NA-196 Qambar-Shahdadkot.\n\nWhen asked to assure the public that after quitting NA-196, if he secured NA-194, Qambar-Shahdadkot's public would not be left at the mercy of tribal chiefs, the PPP's chairman said he would himself be answerable for development in both NA-194 and NA-196.\n\nHe said the caretaker government's response to Israel's brutal onslaught on Gaza has been appropriate and that Pakistan's UN Ambassador Munir Akram has also been raising his voice assertively on that international platform.\n\nHowever, he believed that an elected government would be able to more proactively support the cause of Palestine.",

    "articleBody": "Recalling Jesus\u2019 birth in a stable in Bethlehem, Pope Francis in a Christmas Eve homily said that \u201cthe clash of arms even today\" prevents Jesus \u201cfrom finding room in the world.\u201d\n\nThe pontiff presided Sunday over the evening Mass attended by about 6,500 faithful who took their place amid the splendor of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica behind rows of white-clad prelates.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war,\u201d the pope said, referring to the war sparked by Hamas\u2019 deadly Oct. 7 rampage and hostage-taking in Israel.\n\nAs Mass began, a statuette of the Christ child was unveiled before the altar bedecked in greenery and white flowers, and children representing all corners of the globe placed flowers around a gilded throne.\n\nFrancis, draped in white robes, led the Mass standing at the foot of one of St. Peter\u2019s grand columns.\n\nRecalling that Jesus was born during a census meant to reinforce King David\u2019s power, Francis warned against \u201cthe quest for worldly power and might, fame and glory, which measures everything in terms of success, results, numbers and figures, a world obsessed with achievement.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Jesus entered the world humbly, taking human flesh. \u201cHere, we see not a god of wrath and chastisement, but the God of mercy, who takes flesh and enters the world in weakness,\u2019\u2019 the pope said.\n\nA pagan deity is linked to \u201cpower, worldly success and idolatry of consumerism,\u201d the pope said. \u201cGod, on the other hand, waves no magic wand; he is no god of commerce who promises everything all at once. He does not save us by pushing a button, but draws near us, in order to change our world from within.\u201d\n\nWhen the Christmas Eve Mass ended, the pope, pushed in a wheelchair, moved down the basilica with the life-sized statue of Baby Jesus on his lap and flanked by children carrying bouquets. The statue was placed in a manger in a nativity scene in the basilica.\n\nFrancis, 87, has been using a wheelchair to navigate long distances due to a painful knee ligament and a cane for shorter distances.\n\nDuring the traditional Angelus blessing overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square at midday, the pontiff remembered those suffering from war, recalling specific fighting in Ukraine and Israel\u2019s bombardment and siege of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cWe are close to our brothers and sisters suffering from war. We think of Palestine, Israel, Ukraine. We also think of those who suffer from misery, hunger, slavery,\u201d Francis said. \u201cMay the God who took a human heart for himself infuse humanity into the hearts of men,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking from the window of his studio to the thousands of faithful gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square for the Angelus prayer, the pontiff also invited the faithful \u201cnot to confuse celebration with consumerism. One can and, as a Christian, must celebrate in simplicity without waste and by sharing with those who lack necessities or lack companionship.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, Catholics mark Christmas Eve by attending Mass at midnight. But over the years, the starting time at the Vatican has crept earlier, reflecting the health or stamina of popes and then the pandemic. The Vatican has kept a 7:30 p.m. time originally set during a pandemic curfew.\n\nOn Christmas Day, tens of thousands of Romans, tourists and pilgrims were expected to crowd into St. Peter\u2019s Square to hear Pope Francis deliver an address on world issues and give his blessing. The speech, known in Latin as \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d (to the city and to the world), is traditionally an occasion to review crises including war, persecution and hunger, in many parts of the globe.",

    "articleBody": "The death toll in Gaza is likely to breach the 20,000 mark, with more than 53,000 wounded as Israeli airstrikes and ground shelling continue to strike all parts of Gaza with little regard to civilian casualties\n\nThe Israeli military continues its intense bombardment of the Gaza strip, killing and injuring dozens of Palestinian civilians, as its genocidal war on Gaza entered its 75th day. Despite the increasingly dire humanitarian situation across Gaza, the Israeli forces once again struck predominantly civilian targets, including refugee camps, hospitals, residential buildings and other locations where civilians were taking refuge. International human rights organizations have issued repeated and desperate appeals for a humanitarian truce and a cessation in fighting to avert further civilian deaths and suffering, but Israel has refused to heed any of their calls. Israeli forces hit all parts of Gaza with airstrikes and artillery attacks, shattering the illusion of \u201csafe\u201d zones in the strip.\n\nThe genocidal Israeli war continues as the United Nations Security Council once again postponed a crucial vote on a ceasefire resolution, now scheduled to be held on Thursday December 21, reportedly over disagreements regarding the text of the resolution. The United States, Israel\u2019s primary global backer, reportedly raised objections to the text calling for \u201can urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities\u201d. On December 8, the US vetoed the UNSC resolution calling for a ceasefire, standing alone, despite widespread demands for a ceasefire from its own population.\n\nOn Monday, December 18, the head of Israel\u2019s spy agency Mossad, CIA Director Bill Burns, and Qatari prime minister, met in Warsaw to begin talks regarding a possible truce and hostage exchange. The Qataris have positioned themselves as conduits to relay information to Hamas.\n\nOn Wednesday, December 20, Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas\u2019 political bureau, traveled to Egypt to hold talks with Egyptian officials about the situation in Gaza, a day after meeting with Iran\u2019s foreign minister to discuss the prospects of a long term, lasting ceasefire.\n\nMeanwhile, as the ceasefire talks inch along and Western governments refuses to put significant pressure on Israel to stop its violence, Palestinian civilians bear the brunt of the indiscriminate and barbaric Israeli war. Bombardments and artillery strikes today and in the last 24 hours struck multiple locations in Rafah, Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah, Gaza city, the Jabalia refugee camp, the al-Rimal neighborhood, the Nuseirat refugee camp, among several other areas. At least 27 Palestinians were killed in the Israeli attacks in Rafah, 13 in Deir al-Balah, 13 in Gaza city, the number of casualties unconfirmed from other areas.\n\nIsraeli attacks on hospitals and health centers also continue.\n\n\ud83d\udea8Urgent: Occupation forces are still besieging the PRCS ambulance center \ud83d\ude91 in #Jabalia, northern #Gaza. \u26a0\ufe0fArtillery shelling continues in the vicinity of the center, with the sounds of explosions heard. Israeli snipers are positioned on the roofs of surrounding buildings,\u2026 \u2014 PRCS (@PalestineRCS) December 20, 2023\n\nThe death toll in Gaza has crossed 20,000, including close to 8,000 children and 4,000 women. Almost 54,000 Palestinians have been wounded. At least 8,000 Palestinians are also missing, feared trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings.\n\nIsraeli violence and repression against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank also continues unabated, with dozens of raids across the Palestinian territory. According to reports, in the last 24 hours, the Israeli security forces, made up of thousands of soldiers and accompanied by drones, armored military vehicles, and military bulldozers, raided numerous cities, towns and villages in the West Bank. Raids were conducted in and around Nablus, Hebron, Jenin, Tulkarm, occupied East Jerusalem, Bethlehem, among other areas. In Nablus, reports stated that Palestinian fighters resisting the invading Israeli soldiers engaged them in sustained firefights.\n\nSince October 7, Israeli forces, in their drastically escalated raids, have killed at least 302 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, while also injuring close to 4,000. They have also illegally arrested and detained more than 4,600 Palestinians in these raids in a little over the last two months.",

For me that's the new message now,\" said one smiling parishioner in Odesa, Olena, whose son is a medic on the front line.\n\nThe date change -- moving away from the Julian calendar favoured by the Orthodox Church -- is part of moves since the invasion to remove traces of the Russian and Soviet empires.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said that it had shot down 28 of the 31 drones that Russia launched on Christmas day at its neighbour, with no casualties reported.\n\nSurfing Santas\n\nIn countries not afflicted by war, festive revellers opened presents and donned the red and white Santa hats for a shot of holiday cheer.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, residents and tourists headed to the beach, wearing the woolly red hats despite the heat in the Southern Hemisphere's summer.\n\nIn Florida, thousands descended on Cocoa Beach for the annual \"Surfing Santas\" celebration that raises funds for a charity helping cancer patients travel for treatment and the local surf museum.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, President Ranil Wickremesinghe granted an amnesty to more than 1,000 convicts and released them from jails across the country to mark Christmas, prison officials said.\n\nPrayers in Turkey\n\nIn southern Turkey, much of which was devastated by an earthquake in February, faithful prayed for new beginnings.\n\n\"It's important for us to celebrate the birth of Jesus. but it's a very sad Christmas,\" said Vehbi Tadrasgil, a 55-year-old who lost his wife and two of his three children in the quake that killed at least 50,000 people in Turkey and more than 5,000 in neighbouring Syria.\n\n\"I hope that their souls are here, I am certain that our prayers rise to them,\" he said in front of the ruins of a church at Antakya.\n\nTwenty kilometres (12 miles) down the coast in Samandag, a generator powered the lights on a tree in front of the Saint-Ilyas church, which survived.\n\n\"After the earthquake, our community -- 400 families -- was annihilated. With this Christmas, we want to wish everyone rebirth, love, joy and peace. We must move forward, rebuild a new life,\" said Father Yumurta.\n\n\"They say that with the birth of the child Jesus, a new life begins, a new beginning.\n\nFor us too, here, it will be a new beginning,\" he said.",

The truce expired in October last year, though fighting largely remains on hold.\n\nGrundberg will now \u201cengage with the parties to establish a roadmap under UN auspices\u201d to end the war.\n\nThe road map also includes commitments to pay civil servants\u2019 salaries, open routes into the rebel-blockaded city of Taez and other parts of Yemen and resume oil exports, according to the statement.\n\n\u201cYemenis are watching and waiting for this new opportunity to provide for tangible results and progress towards lasting peace,\u201d Grundberg said.\n\n\u201cThe parties have taken a significant step. Their commitments are, first and foremost, an obligation to the Yemeni people.\u201d\n\nRed Sea attacks\n\nThe agreement comes amid a flurry of attacks by Al Houthis on key shipping lanes in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where Israel is fighting Hamas militants.\n\nThe Houthis have pledged to attack Israel-linked vessels or ships heading to Israeli ports unless an end is brought to the Israel-Hamas war that started on October 7.\n\nThey have launched more than 100 drone and missile attacks, targeting 10 merchant vessels involving more than 35 different countries, according to the Pentagon.\n\nThe attacks by the rebels are imperilling a transit route that carries up to 12 per cent of global trade, prompting the United States to set up a multinational naval task force to protect Red Sea shipping.\n\nAl Houthi \u201cmilitary actions hinder progress towards a peaceful resolution\u201d, Mohammad Albasha, a senior Middle East analyst for the US-based Navanti Group, told AFP.",

Located in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, several shops, restaurants, and hotels were spotted deserted.As headlines dominated since October 7 by news of the Hamas attacks in Southern Israel, which was followed by Israel\u2019s military assault on Gaza and the rise of violence in the West Bank, business owners in Bethlehem assumed that this year the town would witness a meager Christmas celebration.There are several families running hotels and restaurants for years and have lived and worked in Bethlehem, who seemed shocked with no guests. It is the worst Christmas ever for the people residing in the town, as Bethlehem is shut down for Christmas for the first time. With no Christmas tree, no joy, and no spirit, the town has seen this state for the first time since the Biblical era. Merry Christmas 2023: Hilarious memes and messages to spark your festive cheer Earlier restaurants and hotels used to be fully booked for Christmas, and people had to look for rooms outside the town, however, since the war, everyone canceled their bookings for this and the next year. The town seems to be a ghost town this year with empty dining rooms with no Christmas breakfast and dinner.Since the 1967 war between Israel and its neighboring Arab countries, Israel has occupied the West Bank, which Palestinians want as the core of a future independent state. Israel has built Jewish settlements, which are deemed illegal by most countries across the territory.The dispute in Israel has caused riots in many historical and biblical cities. And now, several of its ministers live in settlements and favor their expansion. But, since October 7, the West Bank has experienced a rise in attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinians which were already at a 15-year high this year before the Hamas attack.Bethlehem's Manger Square which is a large paved space in front of the Church of the Nativity is the focal point for Christmas celebrations which is now quiet and empty with souvenir shops around to be shut.",

These strikes, part of the escalating conflict in the region, raise questions and fears about the future of this fragile geopolitical hotspot.\n\nA New Day, A New Strike\n\nAt approximately 7:00 a.m. today, the silence of Aitaroun was shattered by hostile artillery shelling from enemy positions within the occupied Palestinian territories. Israeli artillery forces targeted the town, causing potential casualties and significant damage. The strikes are another grim chapter in the ongoing conflicts in the region, often characterized by the presence of foreign military forces and territorial disputes.\n\nCountering Fire with Fire\n\nAs the dust settled in Aitaroun, the militant group Hezbollah retaliated with explosive drones and missiles, escalating tensions further. Israel\u2019s response to these retaliations has been swift and severe, with air strikes rocking several towns and villages in south Lebanon. So far, the violence has claimed the lives of over 120 people in Lebanon, including 85 Hezbollah fighters and 16 civilians. On the Israeli side, seven soldiers and four civilians have lost their lives.\n\nThe Struggle for Peace\n\nDespite the violence and rising tensions, efforts towards peace continue. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) remains dedicated to maintaining a buffer between Israeli and Lebanese forces.

    "articleBody": "The United States, key allies and Arab nations engaged in high-level diplomacy in hopes of avoiding another US veto of a new UN resolution on desperately needed aid to Gaza. The long-delayed vote, last scheduled for Thursday morning, was postponed again.\n\nUS Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood told reporters as he headed into a Security Council meeting on Syria that \"We're still working it. We're working it very hard.\" He said there needed to be some changes in the text \"that would make it worthy of our support.\" No new time was set for a vote, and diplomats said Russia called for closed consultations among the 15 council members Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe US has been struggling to change the text's references to a cessation of hostilities in the Israel-Hamas war, but the key sticking point is the inspection of aid trucks entering into Gaza to ensure they are only carrying humanitarian goods. The current draft calls for the UN to take over the job from Israel.\n\nNathan Evans, the spokesman for the US Mission to the United Nations, stressed that the resolution's goal is to expand aid getting into Gaza.\n\n\"There are still serious and widespread concerns that this resolution as drafted could actually slow down delivery of humanitarian aid by directing the UN to create an unworkable monitoring mechanism,\" Evans told The Associated Press. \"We must ensure any resolution helps and doesn't hurt the situation on the ground.\" Both the UN and aid groups worry that if the UN is placed in charge of inspections, it would delay deliveries into Gaza and may not even be possible. Israel insists it must maintain the lead on inspecting deliveries.\n\nA council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions were private, said the US and Egypt are engaging directly to ensure any aid monitoring mechanism can work for everyone.\n\nIn a sign of intense US efforts, President Joe Biden told reporters on his way back from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, late Wednesday that \"we're negotiating right now at the UN the contours of a resolution that we may be able to agree to\".\n\nAmbassador Lana Nusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates, which sponsored the Arab-backed resolution, said earlier that high-level discussions are underway to try to reach agreement on a text that can be adopted.\n\n\"Everyone wants to see a resolution that has impact and that is implementable on the ground,\" she told reporters after the 15 council members held closed consultations early Wednesday afternoon and agreed to the delay. \"We believe today, giving a little bit of space for additional diplomacy, could yield positive results.\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to the foreign ministers of Egypt and UAE late Wednesday, according to a US official, but the results of the call were unclear.\n\nAs part of the US push at the UN, Blinken spoke Wednesday with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom and stressed the need for urgent humanitarian aid to Gaza, \"the imperative of minimizing civilian casualties,\" and preventing further escalation of the conflict and ''underscored the US commitment to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.\n\nNusseibeh said the UAE is optimistic, but if the negotiations yield no results by Thursday \"then we will assess in the council to proceed...to a vote on the resolution\". The vote was first scheduled for Monday.\n\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has said Gaza faces \"a humanitarian catastrophe\" and that a total collapse of the humanitarian support system would lead to \"a complete breakdown of public order and increased pressure for mass displacement into Egypt\".\n\nAccording to a report released Thursday by 23 UN and humanitarian agencies, Gaza's entire 2.2 million population is in a food crisis or worse and 576,600 are at the \"catastrophic\" starvation level. With supplies to Gaza cut off except for a small trickle, the UN World Food Programme has said 90% of the population is regularly going without food for a full day.\n\nThe draft resolution on the table Monday morning called for an \"urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities,\" but this language was watered down in a new version that was to be put to a vote on Wednesday. It would call \"for the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities.\" That draft also calls for Guterres to quickly establish a mechanism for exclusive UN monitoring of aid deliveries to Gaza \u2014 bypassing the current Israeli inspection of aid entering the strip.\n\nMercy Corps Vice-President Kate Phillips-Barrasso said a resolution calling for a suspension of hostilities is critical to delivering aid to starving people.\n\n\"We urge that an exclusive, independent mechanism be part of that agreement both in principle and in practice,\" she said. ''As in other conflicts, independent monitoring mechanisms are critical to ensuring aid gets to people quickly and does not involve parties to the conflict determining what gets in and how fast.\" US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also raised two other issues Wednesday morning that are not in the Arab-sponsored resolution \u2014 condemnation of Hamas' deadly Oct 7 incursion into southern Israel that sparked the latest war and Israel's right to self-defence.\n\nThe US on Dec 8 vetoed a Security Council resolution, backed by almost all other council members and dozens of other nations, demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza. The 193-member General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a similar resolution on Dec 12 by a vote of 153-10, with 23 abstentions.\n\nIn its first unified action on Nov 15, with the US abstaining, the Security Council adopted a resolution calling for \"urgent and extended humanitarian pauses\" in the fighting, unhindered aid deliveries to civilians and the unconditional release of all hostages.\n\nSecurity Council resolutions are important because they are legally binding, but in practice many parties choose to ignore the council's requests for action. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they are a significant barometer of world opinion.\n\nNearly 20,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, since the war started. During the Oct 7 attack, Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took about 240 hostages back to Gaza.\n\nHamas controls the Gaza Strip, and its Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Thousands more Palestinians lie buried under the rubble of Gaza, the UN estimates.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

With the ICC rejecting Khawaja's gesture (wearing shoes with messages) to express solidarity with the Palestine victims in the Boxing Day Test, Cummins reckons there's nothing offensive about it, but admits that rules are to be accepted.\n\nOn Sunday, Khawaja was spotted training with an image of a dove and Olive branch on the back of his bat and right shoe. The logo remains a reference to an article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, reading 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.' Despite obtaining a green signal for the logo from Cricket Australia and Australian Cricketers' Association, the ICC declined the same.\n\nSpeaking at a presser on Monday, Cummins lauded Khawaja for standing up for his beliefs but feels certain things are out of players' control.\n\nYet To Bat VS Yet To Bat Yet To Bat VS Yet To Bat Live Next Match\n\nHe was quoted as saying by The Sydney Morning Herald:\n\n\"I don\u2019t know the ins and outs of the application, but I think it is pretty vanilla, a dove. We really support Uzzy, I think he\u2019s standing up for what he believes and I think he\u2019s doing it really respectfully. All lives are equal and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very offensive, and I\u2019d say the same about the dove. That\u2019s Uzzy. He can hold his head high the way he\u2019s gone about it, but there\u2019s rules in place, so I believe the ICC have said they\u2019re not going to approve that. They make up the rules and you\u2019ve got to accept it.\"\n\nTrending\n\nCummins suggested that the entire team supports the veteran opener's view that war is futile.\n\n\"I\u2019ve spoken to Uzzy a fair bit.

    "articleBody": "The current Western governments have been giving full and unconditional support to Israel\u2019s oppressive policies and atrocities. Pro-Israeli Western governments do not take into account their citizens\u2019 views on the latest developments in Palestine. They prefer to support the Zionists but not their people. However, they know that their pro-Israeli positions damage their relations with other countries.\n\nThey even avoid discussing Israel\u2019s atrocities, both in their respective domestic setting and on international platforms. They question the legitimacy of any political authority, including the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), that questions Israel\u2019s crimes against innocent Palestinians. However, despite all pro-Israeli political campaigns and media coverage, a large part of the Western public insistently criticizes and opposes the Israeli atrocities. Millions of people from different countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, took to the streets to condemn Israel\u2019s oppressive policies.\n\nOfficers from the New York Police Department guard the entrance to The New York Times as pro-Palestine activists march in the \"Global Strike for Gaza\" in New York City, New York, U.S., Dec. 18, 2023. (AFP Photo)\n\nThe Zionist Israel has been committing all types of crimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, with the unconditional support of its associates, i.e. the governments of the Western countries. While the Israeli government has been hitting any target in the Gaza Strip, including residential areas, marketplaces, hospitals, places of worship (mosques and churches) and schools (including the U.N. schools), pro-Israeli Western governments continue to provide unconditional support to the Zionist regime. While Israeli forces are killing children, women, international aid workers and journalists, pro-Israeli Western governments prefer to remain silent against all these atrocities.\n\nInstead of deterring Israel from committing more violent acts, the Western governments have been trying to abandon their traditional values of free speech and freedom by forbidding their citizens from criticizing Israel\u2019s oppressive policies and atrocities against innocent Palestinians. Pro-Israeli governments are trying to punish institutions or heads of institutions that remain silent about the peaceful demonstrations. Officials in Western countries are trying to undermine the independence of higher education institutions. For example, presidents of some Western universities were punished for their neutral perspectives and their tolerance toward the pro-Palestinian peaceful demonstrations or other kinds of reactions.\n\nTwo political camps\n\nConsidering all these, one can easily see that the world is divided into two political camps: pro-Zionists and anti-Zionists (pro-Palestinians). Compared with the Zionist camp, which is largely concentrated in the West, the anti-Zionist camp is truly global and diverse. The pro-Zionist camp includes the political parties that form the current Netanyahu government, the majority of the Israeli political establishment, most Western governments, some radical Christian groups who also claim to be Zionist, and ultra-nationalist and far-rightist groups. The anti-Zionist (pro-Palestinian) camp consists of most countries (especially the non-Western states), Muslim nations, Arab peoples, the world public opinion (including the Westerners) and a small part of the Jewish people (especially those who live in the Western countries).\n\nThe pro-Zionist camp can be divided into three categories: ideological Zionists (Jewish and Christian Zionists), anti-Muslims (both in the West and the non-Western part of the world), and the pragmatists who support Israel in exchange for a particular material benefit (economic or political gains). Similarly, the anti-Zionist camp can be divided into several categories: Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims and the global coalition. Palestinians and Arabs mainly are anti-Zionists because Zionists occupy their lands, not only Palestinian lands but also lands that belong to Lebanon and Syria. Since Muslims oppose the occupation of Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is accepted as a holy site by all Muslims, they are positioned as anti-Zionists.\n\nDivided coalition\n\nThe global coalition, extending from Indonesia to Canada and Russia to South Africa, is divided into two groups. One group thinks that the Zionist camp represents a traditional imperialist mindset. Therefore, any anti-imperialist or anti-colonialist group supports anti-Zionist social movements and political actors, i.e. Palestinians. The second part of the global coalition opposes the Zionist camp solely for humanitarian reasons. Individuals and people who still have compassion in their hearts and believe in justice support Palestine. They do not want to see the mass killing of innocent children, women, sick and elderly people in Palestine.\n\nAll in all, unlike the Zionist camp, which represents a shallow political objective, the global coalition represents humanity and universal values.",

Yaakov Amidror says, \u201cThe initial lessons from the war are the need to legitimize the option of preventive strikes and wars; expand investment in innovative technology to further improve Israel\u2019s qualitative edge; and increase the defense budget\u2026(to) deploy larger forces to the defense of the borders and to fight simultaneously on more than one front.\u201d These prudent recommendations must be implemented despite the high price Israelis will pay.\n\nBut what if their best plans depend on their indispensable ally, America? In the future, American presidents from the Left who believe Israel is a victimizer of Palestinians or isolationist and deficit-hawk Republicans may, for different reasons, decrease aid to Israel or cut off its supply lines to dictate the longevity of a future war, even if Israel will be profoundly injured.\n\nA Haaretz headline read, \u201cReliance on US Weapons Forces Netanyahu to Accept Biden\u2019s War Requests.\u201d It went on to say, \u201cThe American president is trying to balance his support for Israel with pressure from his base to shape Israeli wartime policy. Military aid packages are proving to be the best piece of leverage that the US holds over Israel.\u201d\n\nPresident Biden has given unprecedented leeway and, so far, an unfettered supply train to Israel, allowing it to prosecute a war going into its third month. The president supports Israel\u2019s goal to destroy Hamas\u2019s military capabilities. Biden proudly calls himself a Zionist, and that should be appreciated and not taken for granted, especially in an era where presidents of major American universities cannot state that calling for the genocide of the Jews violates university policies on harassment. Advertisement\n\nA growing number of Democrats are pressuring the president to call for an immediate ceasefire, which is, in effect, a victory for Hamas. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen is demanding military aid to Israel be conditioned based on the \u201cunacceptably high\u201d number of civilian deaths in Gaza. PRESIDENT ISAAC Herzog and US Vice President Kamala Harris meet in Washington, earlier this year. Harris has warned against \u2018settler violence.\u2019 (credit: Nathan Howard/Reuters)\n\nWould President Harris be as supportive as President Biden?\n\nAmerican voters are keenly aware that if Biden is reelected, his vice president has a good chance of becoming president during his second term. Will Vice President Kamala Harris be as supportive of Israel in its next war? Will she supply the weapons and diplomatic support that President Biden has done during this war? Advertisement\n\nAmerica has disproportionate leverage over Israel because of its dependency on American arms, memoranda of understanding for military aid, and protection of Israel in international bodies with its veto on the United Nations Security Council. But Israelis need freedom of action to confront enemies, starting with Iran and its nuclear program and against its proxies, Hezbollah, PIJ, Houthis, and Hamas.\n\nSupply lines and stockpiled ammunition may not sound sexy like the next generation of laser technology (Iron Beam) to stop enemy missiles, but they are the lifeblood of a military. In 1973, Egypt devastated the Israeli air and conventional forces. Only a rapid resupply of weapons and munitions staved off a catastrophe.\n\nWith young Americans sympathizing more with Palestinians even in light of the gang rapes, mutilations, torture, and murder committed on October 7, Israel\u2019s strategic planners need to anticipate the years ahead when these voters define a significant segment of the Democratic party. The Republican isolationists, for the foreseeable future, will not be in ascendency. Advertisement\n\nA foreboding harbinger for Israel is a Harris-Harvard poll showing that two-thirds of Gen Z Americans think that \u201cJews as a class are oppressors,\u201d and 20% believe the Holocaust was a myth. According to a National Review headline based on the same poll, \u201cHalf of Young Americans Say Israel Should Be \u2018Ended and Given to Hamas.\u201d\n\nThese potential future leaders should affect Israeli military planning in the decades to come as they become a growing anti-Israel caucus within Congress, shape social media, and are likely to be receptive to boycotting Israel from their seats in corporate boardrooms.\n\nCAN ISRAEL go it alone? Years ago, Israel tried to develop the Kfir fighter jet after its primary source, the French, embargoed the delivery of its Mirage fighter to Israel. That didn\u2019t end well.\n\nTrouble could be right around the corner as there will be growing pressure by the administration for Israel to accept a two-state solution after the war, ignoring the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research poll showing that \u201c57% of Palestinians in Gaza and 82% in the West Bank\u201d supported the Hamas massacre on October 7th. If Israel resists, some members of the administration will call for conditioning military aid until Israel acquiesces.\n\nIsrael is dependent on America. How long the relationship will last as the American electorate changes is an open question. Israel may not be able to build a state-of-the-art fighter jet by itself, but the US does value Israel\u2019s advanced technological contributions to our F-35 program. Joint programs with greater Israeli participation, like Iron Dome, will make each nation dependent on the other, create a healthier relationship, and make one less likely to fray under political pressure.\n\nIsrael\u2019s long-range planning needs to anticipate that a future American president may want to leverage supplying weapons to pressure Israel into uncomfortable compromises. America\u2019s willingness to continue its current level of military aid cannot be taken for granted. Diversifying weapons procurement and production is another long-range consideration.\n\nIn the meantime, stockpiling much more significant quantities of munitions and other essential equipment for extended battles is vital for freedom of action. This will require substantial additional Israeli financial resources that will be hard to come by, as the economic effects of this war on the Israeli economy are likely to be profound.\n\nThe writer is the director of MEPIN (Middle East Political Information Network).

    "articleBody": "Most Destructive in Recent History\n\nThe Associated Press had a story yesterday (December 21, 2023 ) \u2013 in fact, the lead story \u2013 titled: Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza seen as among the most destructive in recent history, experts say. The article reports about the extensive physical damage inflicted on the Gaza Strip by Israel\u2019s military campaign, and compares this battleground\u2019s devastation relative to battlegrounds in other wars. The article gives scant mention to the reason why this military campaign is so destructive \u2013 and only in the very last paragraph when many readers have stopped reading, or their eyes have glazed over. Of course, the reason this campaign is so destructive is because no other war has been waged against an army that conducts its warfare from an underground warren of tunnels that permeates the entire population center, requiring the destruction of civilian infrastructure only because Hamas is embedded in and under that infrastructure. The article also entirely neglects to mention that, under international law, Israel is entirely within its rights to bomb civilian infrastructure when that infrastructure is part of shielding military activity of combatants. This AP article, then, fails to give the context [I so hate using this word] for Israel\u2019s actions, and is designed to engender disgust of Israel\u2019s military activity without heaping any scorn on Hamas\u2019 usage of civilians and civilian infrastructure \u2013 apartment buildings, mosques, schools and hospitals \u2014 as human shields.\n\nA recent interview by Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk on Russian television puts this very much in perspective. When he was asked by the interviewer why Hamas does not let the citizens of Gaza seek protection from Israeli bombing in the tunnels, he replied: \u201cThe tunnels in Gaza were built to protect Hamas fighters, not civilians; protecting Gaza civilians is the responsibility of the UN and Israel.\u201d So, this is why Gaza is being leveled.",

These include A.P. Moller Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd, NYK Line, Evergreen Line, CMA-CGM and Mediterranean Shipping Company.\n\nThe Red Sea is one the world's most important routes for energy and consumer cargoes. It is a key oil supply artery between Europe, the Middle East and Asia via the Suez Canal, accounting for over 10% of global sea seaborne crude according to maritime services and information provider Lloyd's Register.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Hamas supporting Houthis have been targeting ships travelling through the Bab al-Mandab Strait - a 20 mile-wide sea channel at the tip of the Red Sea between Djbouti and Yemen connecting the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden.\n\ngetty\n\nThe targets of Houthi drone and rocket attacks are ships purportedly heading to Israel following an escalation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nBut waves of attacks over the past few weeks appear to be indiscriminate in nature against largely foreign-owned vessels in a maritime route that is already considered perilous from a navigational standpoint.\n\nIn a statement, BP said: \"The safety and security of our people and those working on our behalf is BP's priority. In light of the deteriorating security situation for shipping in the Red Sea, BP has decided to temporarily pause all transits through the Red Sea.\n\n\"We will keep this precautionary pause under ongoing review, subject to circumstances as they evolve in the region.\"\n\nWith industry peers likely to follow and adopt a similar stance while the situation in the Middle East remains volatile, a new Suez crisis may well be brewing. A U.S.-led naval initiative aimed at protecting shipping - akin to the one aimed at combating Somali piracy in recent years - is rapidly taking shape.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES Bounce In U.S. Production And OPEC Cuts Reshaping Oil Market Landscape\n\nFurthermore, the possibility of a U.S.-led coalition attacking the Houthis to protect the shipping route cannot be ruled out. Such an escalation, however temporary, could have profound consequences for the global economy.\n\nThe latest wave of suspension of maritime activity through the Red Sea means many shippers are having to route cargoes between Asia and Europe around Cape of Good Hope on Africa's southern coastline instead of the Suez Canal.\n\nSuch a switch increases the journey distance between both continents by nearly 40%, adding on average an extra 3,000 nautical miles, not to mention an escalation in costs and transit times associated with the move.",

He led the Mass at the iconic St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican, expressing profound solidarity with those suffering amidst the relentless conflict in Gaza.\n\nContrasting Quests for Power\n\nPope Francis highlighted the stark contrast between the pursuit of worldly power and the divine approach to addressing injustice. He emphasized that God\u2019s response to injustice is through love and compassion rather than a formidable show of force. This standpoint is particularly significant in the current context, as he has persistently called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas since the onset of the conflict in early October.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s Firm Stance\n\nOn the same day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a public address, reaffirmed Israel\u2019s determination to prevail against what he referred to as \u2018barbarians.\u2019 This statement followed a weekend marked by the tragic loss of 14 Israeli soldiers in Gaza.

Israel has ruled that out and says it will agree only limited humanitarian pauses until Hamas is defeated.\n\n\"Hamas' stance remains: they don't have a desire for humanitarian pauses. Hamas wants a complete end to the Israeli war on Gaza,\" a Palestinian official said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated that the war would end only with Hamas eradicated, all hostages freed and Gaza posing no more threat to Israel.\n\n\"Whoever thinks we will stop is detached from reality...All Hamas terrorists, from the first to the last, are dead men walking,\" he said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael has faced increasing pressure from its Western allies to curb a military onslaught in Gaza that has laid waste to much of the densely populated coastal enclave.\n\nThe U.S., Israel's closest ally, has stepped up calls in the past week for it to scale down its all-out war into a focused campaign against Hamas leaders and end what Biden has called \"indiscriminate bombing\" causing huge civilian casualties.\n\nIn a serious spillover from the war, Yemen's Houthi forces have been firing missiles and drones at commercial shipping in the Red Sea to underline support from Iran's Arab militia proxies for the Palestinians against Israel, and the U.S. this week set up a multinational force to ward off the attacks.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Houthis' leader warned they would strike U.S. warships if their forces were targeted by Washington.\n\nINTENSIFYING WAR\n\nInside Gaza, Reuters saw wounded victims of Israeli bombing, including at least two small children covered in blood and dust, carried into the Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. At the hospital morgue, women wearing black abaya robes wailed by bodies laid out in black bags and white shrouds.\n\nAt least 20 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on two houses in Khan Younis, the Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank said.\n\nSince the last truce collapsed on Dec. 1, the war has entered a more intensive phase, with ground combat previously confined to the northern half of the Gaza Strip now spread across the length of the territory.\n\nInternational aid groups say Gaza's 2.3 million people have been driven to the brink of catastrophe by wholesale destruction that has driven 90% of them from their homes and left many malnourished and gravely short of clean water and medical care.\n\nIn the north, which Israeli forces claimed to have largely subdued last month, fighting has been fiercer than ever. Flames and smoke towered into the sky as seen from across the boundary fence in Israel, as Israeli warplanes pounded the area at dawn.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli forces had besieged its ambulance depot in Jabalia, a northern settlement that has been embattled for weeks. There are 127 people in the facility including workers, displaced people and wounded.\n\nIn the south, where most civilians are now sheltering after fleeing other areas, there has been intense fighting around the centre of Khan Younis, which Israeli forces have partly stormed.\n\nHamas has waged guerrilla-style warfare based on a vast web of underground tunnels where it has hidden fighters, weaponry and, Israel says, political leaders and armed-wing commanders.\n\nHamas' armed wing Al Qassam Brigades said on Wednesday its fighters killed 25 Israeli soldiers and injured dozens more over the prior 72 hours in Gaza. The Hamas fighters targeted Israeli troops at point-blank range and booby-trapped two tunnels and a house, an Al Qassam spokesperson said. Reuters could not independently verify the account.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel's military said soldiers had unearthed a network of tunnels, accessed by spiral staircases and an elevator, running deep beneath central Gaza City from properties registered to Yahya Sinwar and other senior Hamas figures. They had used the tunnels for \"protected daily movement\", it said.",

Besides, the petitioner has not informed the respondents by issuing notices to them about the filing of the petition.\n\nConsequently, the court office returned the petition to the petitioner lawyers in original for removal of the deficiencies within a fortnight by January 6, 2024.\n\nThe petition argued that the petitioner had moved an application for the suspension of the three-year sentence with the main appeal which came up for hearing before the IHC on August 28.\n\nDuring the arguments, a request was made to the high court to suspend the operation of the sentence.\n\nThe sentence was challenged by the petitioner, the petition claimed, since it suffered from jurisdictional defects.\n\nOn August 8, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issued a notification to disqualify the appellant under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, without even giving the petition an opportunity of being heard.\n\nUnder the recent amendments to the Elections Act 2017, the period of disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution has been reduced to five years from the earlier life term.\n\nThe petition pleaded that the ECP notification was never communicated to the petitioner who at that time was behind bars.\n\nThe petition argued that attempts were being made to take away the symbol of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) as well and throw it out of the election arena, according to Dawn.\n\nThe cricketer-turned-politician was convicted on August 5 and arrested but the Islamabad High Court granted him bail. However, he has not been released due to his arrest in some other cases.\n\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",

(Photo: AFP)\n\nNEW YORK - The United Nations (UN) Security Council voted on Friday to approve a resolution that demands all sides in the Israel-Hamas conflict allow the \"safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale.\"\n\nAfter days of delays, the resolution also called for the creation of \"conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities\" but it did not call for an immediate end to fighting.\n\nRussia and the United States, which both could have vetoed the measure as permanent members of the council, abstained, meaning it passed with 13 votes in favour.\n\nNonetheless, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield called the resolution \"a strong step forward.\"\n\n\"This council provided a glimmer of hope among a sea of suffering,\" she said.\n\nDiplomatic wrangling at UN headquarters in Manhattan -- causing the vote to be postponed several times this week -- has come against the backdrop of deteriorating conditions in Gaza and a mounting death toll.\n\nRussian ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya hit out at the US, saying \"they have resorted to their favourite tactic... of twisting of arms\", calling the text \"toothless.\"\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) sponsored the resolution, which was amended in several key areas to secure compromise.\n\nThe UAE's ambassador to the UN Lana Zaki Nusseibeh said \"it responds with action to the dire humanitarian situation.\"\n\n\"We know this is not a perfect text... We will never tire of calling for a humanitarian cease-fire,\" she said.\n\n- Mounting death toll -\n\nThe resolution demands all sides \"allow and facilitate the use of all... routes to and throughout the entire Gaza Strip, including border crossings... for the provision of humanitarian assistance.\"\n\nIt also requests the appointment of a UN humanitarian coordinator to oversee and verify third-country aid to Gaza.\n\nAn earlier text had said that the aid mechanism to accelerate the delivery of relief would be \"exclusively\" under UN control.\n\nIt now states it would be managed in consultation with \"all relevant parties\" -- meaning Israel would retain operational oversight of aid deliveries.\n\nIsrael on Thursday bombed a newly reopened aid crossing, Hamas authorities said.\n\nMembers of the 15-member Security Council had been grappling for days to find common ground on the resolution, as criticism mounted over the body's lack of action since the start of the war.\n\nIsrael, backed by its ally the United States, has opposed the term \"cease-fire,\" and Washington had used its veto twice to thwart resolutions backed by a majority of other members.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday there would be no cease-fire in Gaza until the \"elimination\" of Hamas.\n\nThe tussle over the resolution came as the UN's hunger monitoring system warned \"every single person in war-torn Gaza is expected to face high levels of acute food insecurity in the next six weeks.\"\n\nHamas infiltrated Israel on Oct 7 and killed around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, while taking about 250 people hostage, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nIsrael has responded with a relentless air and ground campaign.

    "articleBody": "The Quaid going through a document.\n\nAROUND 1899, empire\u2019s beloved envoy, Rudyard Kipling \u2014 fresh from Lahore \u2014 wrote \u2018The White Man\u2019s Burden\u2019, urging the master race to serve \u201cyour new-caught, sullen peoples, half devil and half child.\u201d\n\nAddressed to America, the poem was a hit in his home colony: at a safe remove from the world wars, the British Raj seemed set to rule forever.\n\nBut not everyone was for it: per the anti-imperialist poet Wilfred Scawen Blunt, \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden, Lord, is the burden of his cash.\u201d Praised by no less a fellow critic than Edward Said, Blunt was a rather unique son of Sussex. (\u201cThe British Empire is a structure that might crumble at any moment,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe sooner the better, say I.\u201d)\n\nHe was also an early voice \u2014 per some, the first \u2014 to argue for a separation of the Hindu and Muslim parts of India, if retaining a common British defence. Writing a day short of 140 years ago, he wished \u201cto put Northern India practically under Mohammedan [government], Southern India under Hindu government \u2026\u201d.\n\nBlunt\u2019s proposal \u2014 which, per historian K.K. Aziz, was of \u201cbreathtaking novelty\u201d for 1883 \u2014 landed at the close of a century that had seen nonstop tragedy for India\u2019s Muslims. The most searing case had been 1857, which ended in a years-long revenge spree by the Crown: natives were fi red from cannons, others driven from their homes.\n\n\u201cWhen the angry lions entered the city,\u201d Ghalib wrote of the British taking back Delhi, \u201cthey killed the helpless and burned [their] houses.\u201d Yet even after the swords were put away, the minority was still seen as the culprit: Punjab\u2019s John Lawrence, for one, felt the Muslims had \u201cdisplayed a more active, vindictive, and fanatic spirit than the Hindus \u2014 but these traits are characteristic of the race.\u201d\n\nThus, when Lawrence\u2019s statue went up on the Mall outside the Lahore High Court, it was inscribed with a warning for the city\u2019s angry young men: \u201cWill you be governed by the pen or the sword?\u201d For India\u2019s foremost Muslim leader at the time, Sayyid Ahmed Khan, the answer could only be the pen.\n\nScarred by 1857, his lectures to fellow believers to stop spitting on the Union Jack \u2014 and learn something, get a job, and grow strong along the way \u2014 were scorned by Muslim conservatives too freshly humiliated to pull focus. Rather than see his Aligarh College as an oasis, they dismissed it as an assembly line for British flunkies.\n\nBesides, Sayyid Ahmed was a bit of a morning star; his thinking too ahead of its time to sway the Muslim mass. To him, siding with the Crown \u2014 a temporary overlord \u2014 was a matter of tactics, and guarding against the Hindu majority \u2014 a permanent overclass \u2014 a matter of strategy. \u201cSuppose \u2026 the whole English army were to leave \u2026 then who would be the rulers of India?\u201d he asked Meerut in 1888. \u201cIs it possible that under these circumstances two nations \u2014 the Muhammadans and the Hindus \u2014 could sit on the same throne and remain equal in power?\n\nMost certainly not. It is necessary that one of them should conquer the other and thrust it down.\u201c While never urging division like Blunt \u2014 and thus, per one historian, stopping in the middle of his own argument \u2014 Sayyid Ahmed nonetheless pointed to the divide at the heart of imperial India: the expression \u2018two nations\u2019 was his result.\n\n\u201cBy the 1930s, Jinnah had closed out the first two phases of his public life: as an ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity, and then as a frustrated moderate amid Gandhi fever. The third phase, as we all know, was embracing the idea of Pakistan\u201d\n\nThe next clear plan for separation \u2014 for which a primary source exists \u2014 would come from Hindu sectarian Lala Lajpat Rai in 1924, urging \u201ca clear partition \u2026 into a Muslim India and a non-Muslim India.\u201d Appalled by the idea of separate electorates ripping through his Bharat, Rai thought it best to take a knife to the whole thing. He would be killed by lathi charge four years later.\n\nFinally \u2014 in the last landmark before the Lahore resolution \u2014 it was fiery Cambridge student Rahmat Ali\u2019s pamphlet in 1933 that spelled out the surest plan for partition, and also coined the new state a name: \u2018Pakistan\u2019 or land of the pure, pulled from Punjab, Afghania, Kashmir, Sindh, and Balochistan. (Bengal showed up in its own right, as the unfortunately named \u2018Bangistan\u2019.) During all of this \u2014 the pre-partition trinity of Blunt, Rai, and Rahmat \u2014 leading lawyer Muhammad Ali Jinnah was still miles short of calling for independence.\n\nThis also brings us to a bit of a delicate point: to say poet Iqbal dreamt up the idea around the same time, as Pak Studies types so often do, isn\u2019t borne out by the record. His famous Allahabad address of 1930 did indeed wish for \u201cPunjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sindh, and Balochistan\u201d to be \u201camalgamated into a single state,\u201d but \u201cwithin the body-politic of India.\u201d\n\nAfter all, Iqbal meant \u2018state\u2019 in the lowercase Indian fashion, as a province (the uppercase \u2018S\u2019 is a sly revision in later texts by other writers). Son Javid Iqbal confirms in his book Islam and Pakistan\u2019s Identity that this was for a \u201cMuslim India within India, as the word \u2018state\u2019 used by Iqbal, only implied the grant of full autonomy\u2026\u201d The elder Iqbal clarified as much in his letter of October 12, 1931: that such \u201cMuslim provinces \u2026would be the bulwark of India \u2026 against the hungry generations of the Asiatic highlands.\u201d\n\nHe wrote again of Hindu-Muslim ties in 1931, \u201c\u2026 I cannot allow myself to believe \u2026 that all human efforts directed to uniting the two communities are doomed to failure.\u201d\n\nTo say Iqbal thereby doesn\u2019t figure in Pakistan\u2019s genesis, however, is unkind. While enough has been written on the hold his words had on the Muslim street, he had also endorsed the politics of partition by 1937. His letter of June 21, addressed to Jinnah, is definitive: \u201cA separate federation of Muslim provinces \u2026 is the only course by which we can secure a peaceful India and save Muslims from the domination of non-Muslims.\n\nThe Quaid addresses a mammoth gathering at Dacca\u2019s Racecourse Ground on March 22, 1948. He declared at the meeting that Urdu would be the lingua franca of Pakistan.\n\nWhy should not the Muslims \u2026 be considered a nation entitled to self-determination \u2026? \u201cWhich brings us, at last, to creation\u2019s key fi gure. By the 1930s, Jinnah had closed out the first two phases of his public life: as an ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity, and then as a frustrated moderate amid Gandhi fever.\n\nThe third phase, as we all know, was embracing the idea of Pakistan, and creating a country less than a decade after it was proposed. \u201cI am an Indian first and a Muslim afterwards,\u201d Jinnah said, \u201cbut \u2026 no Indian can serve his country if he neglects the interests of the Muslims.\u201d Less remarked-upon is what caused that final shift.\n\nWhile turning points are aplenty, perhaps the clearest came in 1928, when Gandhi\u2019s populist magic met the cold, black-letter law of the Nehrus. Unlike his easily bored son, Motilal Nehru was a seasoned lawyer.\n\nWhen he brought out the Nehru Report \u2014 the all-Indian counter to a British roadmap \u2014 Jinnah was left reeling: his constitutional safeguards had been tossed out the window.\n\nBut these had been the great work of his life, going as far back as the Lucknow pact in 1916, when Jinnah\u2019s skill had gotten even hardliners like Tilak and Lajpat Rai to comfort an anxious minority \u2014 promising the Muslims separate electorates, as well as reserving them a third of the central legislature, greater than their numbers.\n\n\u201cAs the Quaid nears his 150th birthday, the idea of Pakistan has been made real for a while now. Yet it remains as unfulfilled as ever\u201d\n\nBut those handshakes had been a while ago: the Congress of the late 1920s and \u201930s was a new beast altogether as the logic of brute majority started dawning on winner and loser alike. Even when Jinnah went as far as dropping separate electorates \u2014 in return for keeping a third of the assembly \u2014 it mattered nothing to the Congress bosses.\n\nIn his letter to Gandhi, Motilal jeered that \u201ceven the most advanced Mussalmans\u201d had given up such a demand, leaving \u201cthe Ali brothers and Jinnah to stew in their own juices.\u201d All said, Jinnah had asked for a tiny piece of the federal pie; just not tiny enough for Motilal.\n\nThe Hindu-Muslim question would be settled, Motilal wrote to Annie Besant, \u201cby throwing a few crumbs here and there to the small minorities.\u201d With such indifference all around, it was becoming obvious that the Congress and the League had fundamentally different visions for India\u2019s future.\n\nHence, also, Jinnah\u2019s heartbroken farewell to the nationalist cause at 1928\u2019s end. Up against a hostile audience at the all-parties convention at Calcutta, he pleaded for reason. One Congressite called him \u201ca spoilt child\u201d and \u201ca naughty child\u201d; the Hindu Mahasabha said he was a fringe wonder.\n\nJinnah didn\u2019t take the bait. \u201c\u2026 Here I am not speaking as a Mussalman but as an Indian,\u201d he told them gently. \u201c\u2026 Minorities cannot give anything to the majority.\n\nIt is, therefore, no use asking me not to press for what you call these small points. I am not asking for these modifications because I am a \u2018naughty child\u2019 \u2026 I am asking you for this adjustment because I think it is the best and fair to the Mussalmans \u2026 Majorities are apt to be tyrannical and oppressive and particularly towards religious minorities \u2026 We are all sons of this land. We all have to live together.\u201c\n\nOtherwise, \u201cif we cannot agree, let us at any rate agree to differ, but let us part as friends.\u201d And part he did: when he left, Jinnah kicked away the Nehru Report as a \u2018Hindu document\u2019 \u2014 the sort of binary that would now colour his speeches and statements. Unity was over.\n\nBut Pakistan was yet to beckon. Stunned by his wife\u2019s death and abandoned by his own cause, Jinnah spent a lonely wilderness in private practice in London.\n\nDiscussions with Liaquat and letters from Iqbal followed, as did politely brushing off Rahmat and his friends: \u201cMy dear boys, don\u2019t be in a hurry; let the waters flow and they will fi nd their own level.\u201d From 1937 to 1939, Jinnah\u2019s foes in Congress, in power at last, stirred those separatist waters all by themselves; his tone hardened with it.\n\n\u201cWe Muslims have made up our minds to have our fullest rights,\u201d Jinnah told Patna, \u201cbut we shall have them as rights, not as gifts or concessions.\u201d By 1940, the tide had come in: the idea of Pakistan captured the Muslim imagination like none before it.\n\nBut the extraordinary popularity of the Lahore Resolution meant fresh critiques aimed at the Quaid, as well as the idea he was determined to adopt and now own.\n\nWhile meriting a separate essay by themselves, these can nonetheless be touched upon: that Pakistan was meant as a bargaining counter, for a better deal in undivided India. This writer has rebutted that claim in detail elsewhere, whereas Jinnah sighed almost every year since the resolution that \u201cit is not a counter for bargaining\u201d, and to \u201cremove from your mind any idea of some form of such loose federation\u201d. Amid these countless denials post-1940, not a single credible source where Jinnah says otherwise has so far been discovered.\n\nThere\u2019s also the canard that Jinnah\u2019s Pakistan was a British plot. But this glides over the fact that the vast majority of empire\u2019s officials would go on record again and again to oppose Pakistan, not least for what it meant for defence: the division of the Indian army, with the Russian bear breathing down the mountains.\n\n(The hilarious claim that the British wanted a \u2018buffer zone\u2019, defended by two small armies instead of one, is yet more magical thinking.) Even past guns and steel, the coloniser would also weep for India\u2019s unity for emotional reasons. India had a geographic, racial, and above all \u2018political unity\u2019, wrote secretary of state Leo Amery in 1941, \u201c\u2026 which we have confirmed in far stronger fashion than any of our predecessors \u2026 I would say, indeed, that if some sort of Indian unity had not existed, it would have to be invented.\u201d\n\nThis form of self-soothing was part of a broader trend \u2014 the white man\u2019s burden in crisis. As historian Sikandar Hayat has rightly pointed out, \u201cNeither Linlithgow, Zetland, nor Wavell, Amery, Attlee, or Mountbatten supported the [Pakistan] demand.\u201d But for a lull during the war, when the League was preferable to a striking Congress, the Raj sprung right back to its default contempt for Jinnah\u2019s party as soon as the Japanese fell.\n\nAll this bad blood is only ever countered with a few random letters between Jinnah and Churchill, an opposition relic far from the levers of government, who\u2019d never wanted to free India anyway. Taken together, London\u2019s endlessly documented sneering at Pakistan is met with near-zero evidence to the contrary.\n\nMost important, the minority question: if Pakistan was meant to be a land where the Muslims could breathe free, what of the millions left behind in India? For Jinnah, his answer would unvaryingly be in terms of the greatest good, as a counter-question: whether all of Muslim India \u201cshould be subjected to a Hindu-majority Raj, or whether at least six crores of Mussalmans residing in the areas where they form a majority should have their own homeland \u2026 and shape their own future destiny \u2026?\u201d More recent treatments of the idea also merit mentioning.\n\nIn Creating a New Medina, Venkat Dhulipala is correct to say Pakistan was no vague slogan; he isn\u2019t as correct in the latter half of his thesis \u2014 that it was a popularly envisioned theocracy. Save a few clergymen, the religious right overwhelmingly rejected Pakistan and attacked Jinnah, from Maududi\u2019s Jamaat to the Majlis-e-Ahrar to most of the Deoband school. The feeling was mutual: for the Muslim modernists that had founded the new nation, it certainly wasn\u2019t \u201cto be ruled,\u201d per Jinnah, \u201cby priests with a divine mission\u201d.\n\nTo play up such a mission would be almost as wrong as its mirror image, Faisal Devji\u2019s Muslim Zion, linking Pakistan\u2019s birth to Israel\u2019s apartheid project \u2014 as two states that transcended \u2018blood and soil.\u2019 But Pakistan was \u201cof course nothing like Israel,\u201d historian David Gilmartin has already rebutted, \u201c\u2026for the areas that became Pakistan were already occupied by tens of millions of the Muslims in whose name the state was created.\u201d Zafrulla Khan, the Quaid\u2019s foreign minister, opposed Palestine\u2019s partition for the same reasons at the UN.\n\nHence, also, Pakistan as a mass movement that became the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority state at birth, and not a settler militia blasting its way in. To call it a \u2018Muslim Zion\u2019, then, is, as Gilmartin says, \u201can act of historical erasure\u201d.\n\nFinally, we turn to the idea now realised, and what came of its founder\u2019s wishes. Here, unfortunately, there can be no defence: since the creation of Pakistan, Jinnah declared parliamentary sovereignty (Constituent Assembly, August 11, 1947), civilian supremacy (Quetta Staff College, June 14, 1948), and religious pluralism throughout.\n\nToday, the lights are out in all five assemblies, the military establishment reigns supreme, and the country\u2019s minorities eke out their days on the margins, with civil liberties \u2014 closer to the lawyer Jinnah\u2019s heart than anything else \u2014 long faded from view.\n\nAs the Quaid nears his 150th birthday, the idea of Pakistan has been made real for a while now. Yet it remains as unfulfilled as ever.\n\nThe writer is a barrister and columnist.",

    "articleBody": "At the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church in Bethlehem, baby Jesus lies not in a manger but draped in a keffiyeh amid rubble. As the world celebrates the joyous festival, Bethlehem mourns. Rev. Dr. Munther Isaac stands at the pulpit and delivers a sermon, a lament, \u201cIf Jesus was born today\u201d, he says, \u201che\u2019d be born under the rubble.\u201d\n\nSituated six miles south of Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank, Bethlehem holds a central place in Christian history. This year, however, the city stands as a symbol of a different reality. Churches across Palestine, including Bethlehem's Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church, have collectively decided to forego traditional Christmas celebrations. Instead, they express solidarity with Gaza and reject the ongoing aggression against Palestinians.\n\n\"We are angry, we are broken. This should have been a time of joy, instead we are mourning. We are fearful. More than 20,000 killed. Thousands are still under the rubble. Close to 9000 children killed in the most brutal way. Day after day 1.9 million displaced. Hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed. Gaza as we know it no longer exists. This is an annihilation, this is genocide. The world is watching, churches are watching. People of Gaza are sending live images of their own execution. Maybe the world cares but it goes on.\n\nWe are asking could this be our faith in Bethlehem, in Ramallah, in Jenin? Is this our destiny too? We are tormented by the silence of the world. Leaders of the so-called free lined up one after the other to give the green light for this genocide against a captive population. They gave the cover, not only did they make sure to pay the bill in advance, they veiled the truth and context providing the political cover and yet another layer has been added. The theological cover with the Western church stepping into the spotlight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur dear friends in South Africa taught us the concept of the state theology defined as theology, the theological justification of the status quo with its racism, capitalism and totalitarianism. It does so by misusing theological concepts and Biblical texts for its own political purposes. Here in Palestine the Bible is weaponised against us, our very own sacred text. In our terminology in Palestine we speak of the empire. Here we confront the theology of empire, a disguise of superiority, supremacy, chosenness and entitlement. It is sometimes given a nice cover using words like mission and evangelism, fulfilment of prophecy and spreading freedom and liberty. The theology of the empire becomes a powerful tool to mask oppression under the clock of divine sanction. It speaks of land without people. It divides people into us and them. It dehumanises and demonises the concept of land without people again even though they knew too well that the land had people and not just any people, a very special people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheology of empire calls for emptying Gaza just like it called for the ethnic cleansing in 1948, a miracle or a divine miracle as they called it. It calls for us Palestinians now to go Egypt, maybe Jordan. Why not just the sea? I think of the words of the disciples said to Jesus when he was about to enter Samaria, \u201cLord do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?\u201d they said of the Samaritans. This is the theology of the empire, this is what they\u2019re saying about us today.\n\nThis world, this war has confirmed to us, that the world does not see us as equal. Maybe it\u2019s the colour of our skin. Maybe it is because we are on the wrong side of a political equation. Even our kingship in Christ did not shield us. So they say if it takes killing 100 Palestinians to kill a single Hamas militant then so be it. We are not humans in their eyes but in God\u2019s eyes no one can tell us that.\n\nThe hypocrisy and the racism of the western world is transparent and appalling. They always take the word of Palestinians with suspicion and qualification. No we\u2019re not treated equally yet on the other side despite a clear track record of misinformation, lies, their words are almost always deemed infallible.\n\nTo our European friends, I never ever want to hear you lecture us on human rights or international law again and I mean this. We are not white I guess, it does not apply to us according to your own logic. In this war the many Christians in the western world made sure the empire has the theology needed. It is their self-defence we were told and I continue to ask how is the killing of 9,000 children self-defence? How is the displacement of 1.9 million Palestinians self defence?\n\nIn the shadow of the Empire they turned the coloniser into the victim and the colonised into the aggressor. Have we forgotten, have we forgotten that the state they talk to that that state was built on the ruins of the towns and villages of those very same cousins. Have they forgotten?\n\nWe are outraged by the complicity of the church. Let it be clear friends, silence is complicity and empty calls for peace without a ceasefire and an end to occupation and the shallow words of empathy without direct action all under the banner of complicity.\n\nSo here is my message, Gaza today has become the moral compass of the world. Gaza was hell before October 7th and the world was silent. Should we be surprised at their silence now?\n\nIf you are not appalled by what is happening in Gaza, if you are not shaken to your core, there is something wrong with your humanity. And if we as Christians are not outraged by the genocide, by the weaponisation of the Bible to justify it, there is something wrong with our Christian witness and we are compromising the credibility of Our Gospel message.\n\nIf you fail to call this a genocide, it is on you. It is a sin and darkness you willingly embrace. Some have not even called for a ceasefire. I\u2019m talking about churches, I feel sorry for you.\n\nWe will be okay despite the immense blow we have endured, we the Palestinians will recover, we will rise, we will stand up again from the midst of destruction as we have always done as Palestinians. Although this is by far maybe the biggest blow we have received in a long time. But we will be okay\n\nBut for those who are complicit, I feel sorry for you. Will you ever recover from this? Your charity and your words of shock after the genocide wont make a difference. And i know these words of shock are coming and i know people will give generously for charity. But your words wont make a difference. Words of regret wont suffice for you and let me say it, we will not accept your apology after the genocide. What has been done has been done.\n\nI want you to look at the mirror and ask yourself and ask where was I when Gaza was going through a genocide.\n\nIn Gaza today, God is under the rubble.\n\nAnd in this Christmas season, as we search for Jesus, he is to be found not on the side of Rome, but our side of the wall. He\u2019s in a cave, with a simple family, an occupied family, he\u2019s vulnerable. Barely, and miraculously surviving a massacre. Among a refugee family. This is where Jesus is to be found today.\n\nIf Jesus were to be born today, he would be born under the rubble in Gaza. When we glorify pride and richness, Jesus is under the rubble\u2026\n\nWhen we rely on power, might, and weapons, Jesus is under the rubble\u2026\n\nWhen we justify, rationalise, and theologize the bombing of children, Jesus is under the rubble\u2026\n\nJesus is under the rubble. This is his manger. He is at home with the marginalised, the suffering, the oppressed, and displaced. This is his manger. I have been looking and contemplating on this iconic image\u2026. God with us, precisely in this way. THIS is the incarnation. Messy. Bloody. Poverty. This is the incarnation.\n\nAnd this child is our hope and inspiration. We look and see him in every child killed and pulled from under the rubble. While the world continues to reject the children of Gaza, Jesus says: \u201cjust as you did it to one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did it to me.\u201d \u201cYou did it to ME.\u201d Jesus not only calls them his own, he is them! He is the children of Gaza.\n\nWe look at the holy family and see them in every family displaced and wandering, now homeless in despair. While the world discusses the fate of the people of Gaza as if they are unwanted boxes in a garage, God in the Christmas narrative shares their fate; He walks with them and calls them his own.\n\nSo this manger is about resilience and the resilience of Jesus is in his meekness; is in his weakness, is in his vulnerability. The majesty of the incarnation lies in its solidarity with the marginalised. Resilience because this very same child, who rose up from the midst of pain, destruction, darkness and death to challenge empires; to speak truth to power and deliver an everlasting victory over death and darkness. This very same child accomplished this.\n\nThis is Christmas today in Palestine and this is the Christmas message. Christmas is not about Santa, trees, gifts, lights\u2026. My goodness how we twisted the meaning of Christmas. How we have commercialised Christmas. I was in the USA last month, the first Monday after Thanksgiving, and I was amazed by the amount of Christmas decorations and lights, all the and commercial goods. I couldn\u2019t help but think: They send us bombs, while celebrating Christmas in their lands. They sing about the prince of peace in their land, while playing the drum of war in our land.\n\nChristmas in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, is this manger. This is our message to the world today. It is a gospel message, it is a true and authentic Christmas message, about the God who did not stay silent, but said his word, and his Word was Jesus. Born among the occupied and marginalised. He is in solidarity with us in our pain and brokenness.\n\nThis message is our message to the world today \u2013 and it is simply this: this genocide must stop NOW. Why don\u2019t we repeat it, STOP this Genocide NOW.\n\nThis is our call. This is our plea. This is our prayer. Hear oh God. Amen.\u201d\n\n- Rev. Dr. Munther Isaac",

    "articleBody": "According to health sources, at least 68 individuals were killed by an Israeli attack in central Gaza on Sunday, bringing the total number of Israeli troops killed in battle over the weekend to 17.\n\nAssociated Press journalists at a nearby hospital witnessed anxious Palestinians carrying the dead and injured from the Maghazi refugee camp east of Deir al-Balah. One bleeding little girl appeared startled as her body was examined for shattered bones.\n\nAccording to preliminary hospital data, the 68 fatalities include at least 12 women and seven children.\n\n\u201cWe were all targeted,\u201d said Ahmad Turkomani, who lost several family members including his daughter and grandson. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza anyway.\u201d\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry had previously estimated the death toll at 70. The Israeli military did not immediately reply.\n\nAs Christmas Eve came, smoke exploded over the besieged zone, while Bethlehem in the West Bank remained deafeningly quiet, its holiday celebrations postponed. Preliminary discussions on another hostage swap for Palestinians jailed by Israel have resumed in nearby Egypt.\n\nThe violence has destroyed Gaza, killing approximately 20,400 Palestinians and displacing virtually all of the territory\u2019s 2.3 million population.\n\nThe mounting death toll among Israeli soldiers \u2013 156 since the ground offensive began \u2013 might erode public support for the conflict, which began on October 7 when Hamas-led terrorists stormed towns in southern Israel, murdering 1,200 and kidnapping 240.\n\nIsraelis continue to support the country\u2019s declared aims of destroying Hamas\u2019 governmental and military capabilities and freeing the remaining 129 hostages. This is amid mounting worldwide condemnation of Israel\u2019s onslaught, as well as a rising death toll and unimaginable suffering among Palestinians.\n\nHamas exacts a price\n\n\u201cThe war exacts a very heavy price from us, but we have no choice but to continue fighting,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.\n\nIn a nationally televised speech, Israeli President Isaac Herzog appealed for the country to remain united. \u201cThis moment is a test. We will not break nor blink,\u201d he said.\n\nThere has been widespread anger against his government, which many criticize for failing to protect civilians on Oct. 7 and promoting policies that allowed Hamas to gain strength over the years. Netanyahu has avoided accepting responsibility for the military and policy failures.\n\n\u201cOver time, the public will find it hard to ignore the heavy price paid, as well as the suspicion that the aims that were loudly heralded are still far from being attained, and that Hamas is showing no signs of capitulating in the near future,\u201d wrote Amos Harel, military affairs commentator for the Haaretz newspaper.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had completed the dismantling of Hamas\u2019 underground headquarters in northern Gaza, part of an operation to take down the vast tunnel network and kill off top commanders that Israeli leaders have said could take months.\n\nEfforts toward negotiations continued. The head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, arrived in Egypt for talks. The militant group, which also took part in the Oct. 7 attack, said it was prepared to consider releasing hostages only after fighting ends. Hamas\u2019 top leader Ismail Haniyeh traveled to Cairo for talks days earlier.\n\nInside Gaza\n\nIsrael\u2019s offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than two-thirds of the 20,000 Palestinians killed have been women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nOn Friday, Israeli airstrikes on two homes in Gaza killed 90 Palestinians, including dozens from an extended family, according to rescuers and hospital officials. One of the homes, located in Gaza City, became one of the deadliest airstrikes in the war after 76 people from the al-Mughrabi family were killed, said Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense department.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said a 13-year-old boy was shot and killed in an Israeli drone attack while inside al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, a part of Gaza where Israel\u2019s military believes Hamas leaders are hiding.\n\nAn Israeli strike overnight hit a house in a refugee camp west of the city of Rafah, on Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt. At least two men were killed, according to Associated Press journalists in the hospital where the bodies were taken.\n\nAt least two people were killed and six others wounded when a missile stuck a building in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.\n\nAnd Palestinians reported heavy Israeli bombardment and gunfire in Jabaliya, an area north of Gaza City that Israel had claimed to control. Hamas\u2019 military arm said its fighters shelled Israeli troops in Jabaliya and Jabaliya refugee camp.\n\nIsrael faces international criticism for the civilian death toll but it blames Hamas, citing the militants\u2019 use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel has launched thousands of airstrikes since Oct. 7. It says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, without presenting evidence.\n\nIsrael also faces allegations of mistreating Palestinian men and teenage boys detained in homes, shelters, hospitals and elsewhere during the offensive. It has denied abuse allegations and said those without links to militants are quickly released.\n\nSpeaking to the AP from a hospital bed in Rafah after his release, Khamis al-Burdainy of Gaza City said Israeli forces detained him after tanks and bulldozers partly destroyed his home. He said men were handcuffed and blindfolded.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep. We didn\u2019t get food and water,\u201d he said, crying and covering his face.\n\nAnother released detainee, Mohammed Salem, from the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, said Israeli troops beat them. \u201cWe were humiliated,\u201d he said. \u201cA female soldier would come and beat an old man, aged 72 years old.\u201d\n\nInternational pressure\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has passed a watered-down resolution calling for the speedy delivery of humanitarian aid for hungry and desperate Palestinians and the release of all the hostages, but not for a cease-fire.\n\nBut it was not immediately clear how and when deliveries of food, medical supplies and other aid, far below the daily average of 500 before the war, would accelerate. Trucks enter through two crossings: Rafah, and Kerem Shalom on the border with Israel. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, said 123 aid trucks entered Gaza on Sunday,\n\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated U.N. calls for a humanitarian cease-fire, adding on social media that \u201cthe decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy.\u201d\n\nAmid concerns about a wider regional conflict, the U.S. Central Command said a patrol ship in the Red Sea on Saturday shot down four drones launched from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, a while two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into international shipping lanes.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthis say their attacks are aimed at Israel-linked ships in an effort to stop the Israeli offensive in Gaza.",

    "articleBody": "Pope kicks off Christmas celebrations in shadow of war\n\nPope Francis gives sweets to children during the private audience for Christmas Greetings from Vatican Employees in Paul VI hall at the Vatican, on December 21.//AFP\n\nBethlehem, Palestinian Territories \u2013 Pope Francis has kicked off global Christmas celebrations with a call for peace, as Israel\u2019s war on Hamas and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine cast a shadow over one of the world\u2019s favourite holidays.\n\nHaving said earlier in the day that he was thinking of people \u201cwho are suffering from war \u2014 we are thinking of Palestine, of Israel, of Ukraine\u201d, the pope struck a sombre tone during his Christmas Eve mass.\n\n\u201cTonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,\u201d the pope said.\n\nThe biblical city in the occupied West Bank, where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born in a stable more than 2,000 years ago, effectively cancelled the annual Christmas celebrations that normally draw thousands of tourists.\n\nThe town did away with its giant Christmas tree, marching bands and flamboyant nativity scene this year, settling for just a few festive lights.\n\nIn the centre of town, a huge Palestinian flag had been unfolded with a banner declaring that \u201cThe bells of Bethlehem ring for a ceasefire in Gaza\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are dying for this land,\u201d said Nicole Najjar, an 18-year-old student.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to celebrate while our people are dying.\u201d\n\nThe Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said: \u201cWe are here to pray and to ask not only for a ceasefire, a ceasefire is not enough, we have to stop these hostilities and to turn the page because violence generates only violence\u201d.\n\nSister Nabila Salah from the Catholic Holy Church in Gaza \u2014 where two Christian women were killed by an Israeli sniper earlier this month, according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem \u2014 told AFP \u201call Christmas celebrations have been cancelled\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow do we celebrate when we are\u2026 hearing the sound of tanks and bombardment instead of the ringing of bells?\u201d she said.\n\nIn Syria, churches limited celebrations to prayers in solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 left around 1,140 people dead in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest official Israeli figures.\n\nThe Palestinian militants also abducted around 250 people, 129 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.\n\nIsrael retaliated with a sustained bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, where 20,424 people have been killed, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll from the territory\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry.\n\n\u2013 New Christmas Day \u2013\n\n\n\nUkraine, invaded by Russia nearly two years ago, is celebrating Christmas on December 25 for the first time, jettisoning the traditional Orthodox date of January 7, which is feted in Russia, as a snub to Moscow.\n\nIn the southern Black Sea port of Odesa, churchgoers prayed and lit candles as priests in gold vestments held a Christmas Eve service in the Cathedral of the Nativity, decorated with fir trees and a nativity scene.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we really should celebrate Christmas with the whole world, far away, far away from Moscow. For me that\u2019s the new message now,\u201d said one smiling parishioner, Olena, whose son is a medic on the front line.\n\nThe date change \u2014 moving away from the Julian calendar favoured by the Orthodox Church \u2014 is part of moves since the invasion to remove traces of the Russian and Soviet empires.\n\n\u2013 Surfing Santas \u2013\n\nIn countries not afflicted by war, festive revellers donned Santa hats for a shot of holiday cheer \u2014 running a city race in Skopje, North Macedonia; surfing the waves in Florida; jogging along muddy wooded paths on the outskirts of Paris; dipping in the sea near the British port of Dover; or soaking with a drink in hand in Lake Geneva.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, where the big day had already arrived, many residents and tourists headed to the beach, wearing the woolly red hats despite the heat in the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s summer.\n\nAnd children around the globe followed Santa, his reindeer and their present-laden sleigh with the help of Norad Tracks Santa, a 3-D interactive website run annually by a joint US-Canadian military monitoring agency.\n\n\u2013 Prayers in Turkey \u2013\n\nIn southern Turkey, much of which was devastated by an earthquake in February, some faithful celebrated mass in front of the ruins of their church at Antakya.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to celebrate the birth of Jesus. but it\u2019s a very sad Christmas,\u201d said Vehbi Tadrasgil, a 55-year-old who lost his wife and two of his three children in the quake that killed at least 50,000 people in Turkey and more than 5,000 in neighbouring Syria.\n\n\u201cI hope that their souls are here, I am certain that our prayers rise to them,\u201d he said.\n\nTwenty kilometres (12 miles) down the coast in Samandag, a generator powered the lights on a tree in front of the Saint-Ilyas church, which survived.\n\n\u201cAfter the earthquake, our community \u2014 400 families \u2014 was annihilated. With this Christmas, we want to wish everyone rebirth, love, joy and peace. We must move forward, rebuild a new life,\u201d said Father Yumurta.\n\n\u201cThey say that with the birth of the child Jesus, a new life begins, a new beginning. For us too, here, it will be a new beginning,\u201d he said.\n\nby Agence France-Presse",

Even though the fighting has almost stopped, the truce expired in October of last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that these agreements have been made, Grundberg will \u201cengage with the parties to establish a roadmap under UN auspices.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, it includes pledges to restore oil exports, open roads into the rebel-blockaded city of Taiz and other parts of Yemen, and pay civil servants\u2019 salaries.\n\n\u201cYemenis are watching and waiting for this new opportunity to provide for tangible results and progress toward lasting peace,\u201d Grundberg said.\n\n\u201cThe parties have taken a significant step. Their commitments are, first and foremost, an obligation to the Yemeni people.\u201d\n\nThe deal was reached in response to the Houthi rebels\u2019 furious strikes on vital Red Sea shipping lines, which they launched in support of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, where Israel is engaged in combat with Hamas terrorists.\n\nThe Houthis have threatened to strike ships that are associated with Israel or that are sailing toward Israeli ports unless the Israel-Hamas conflict, which broke out on October 7, is resolved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Pentagon claims that they have launched over 100 drone and missile attacks, involving more than 35 different countries, that have targeted 10 merchant boats.\n\nThe US formed a multinational naval task force to defend Red Sea commerce because the rebels\u2019 attacks are threatening a transit route that handles up to 12% of world trade.\n\nMohammed Albasha, a senior Middle East analyst for the US-based Navanti Group, told AFP that the Houthi \u201cmilitary actions hinder progress toward a peaceful resolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Houthis have transitioned\u2026 to becoming aggressors targeting civilian assets,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter eight years, the rebels have taken over large areas of the nation and amassed a tremendous arsenal of weaponry, which they have utilized to launch attacks against other coalition members\u2014Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nMany commentators are skeptical that peace would be restored to Yemen, which is still severely divided along religious, regional, and political lines, as a result of Riyadh\u2019s plans to reduce its military engagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso Read Red Sea Respite: Houthi Attacks Fizzle as Tensions Shift Within Yemen Houthi attacks on ships were significantly reduced for two days.

Last week Israel approved the delivery of aid via its Kerem Shalom crossing but it is hugely insufficient to meet the needs in the devastated territory.\n\nThe pope also called for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \"through sincere and persevering dialogue between the parties, sustained by strong political will and the support of the international community\".\n\nIn his Christmas Eve message late Sunday, the pontiff had called for peace in the Holy Land.\n\n\"Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,\" the pope said.\n\n- 'Peace for Ukraine' -\n\nThe head of 1.3 Catholics in his address also evoked the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen saying he prayed \"that political and social stability will soon be attained\".\n\nFrancis also said he implored \"peace for Ukraine\", which is celebrating Christmas on December 25 for the first time, snubbing the traditional Orthodox date of January 7 feted in Russia.\n\n\"Let us renew our spiritual and human closeness to its embattled people, so that through the support of each of us, they may feel the concrete reality of God\u2019s love,\" he said.\n\nThe pontiff also urged peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have been locked in a territorial conflict for decades, saying: \"May it be advanced by the pursuit of humanitarian initiatives, by the return of refugees to their homes in legality and security, and by reciprocal respect for religious traditions and the places of worship of each community\".\n\nFrancis also touched on the \"conflicts that trouble the region of the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and Sudan, as well as Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan\".\n\nHe said he hoped tensions on the Korean peninsula would be resolved \"by undertaking processes of dialogue and reconciliation capable of creating the conditions for lasting peace\".\n\nThe Argentinian pontiff reserved his last words for the Americas, calling on \"people of good will\" to \"devise suitable ways to resolve social and political conflicts, to combat forms of poverty that offend the dignity of persons, to reduce inequality and to address the troubling phenomenon of migration movements\".",

    "articleBody": "Every year, December 25 is celebrated as Christmas, the day when Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity\u2014the largest and the most widespread religion on earth\u2014chiefly because large swathes of the world before the dark age of Islamic medievalism were ruled by Christian colonisers, was born.\n\nJesus was born in the city of Bethlehem, a town in Israel\u2019s West Bank, which modern-day revisionists refer to as Palestinian lands under the occupation of the Jewish nation.\n\nHowever, at around Christmas every year, like clockwork, claims that \u2018Jesus was a Palestinian\u2019 are bandied around, often by Palestine supporters and Islamists harbouring visceral hatred towards Jews, and Israel in particular.\n\nNeo-Islamists often remain at the forefront in spreading such canards, given that they believe it serves to cement their loyalty to the Ummah by raising their voice for the Palestinians and against Israel, a nation they claimed had annexed the lands that purportedly belonged to the Palestinians.\n\nActor Swara Bhasker, who married politician Fahad Ahmad, is the latest among those peddling the fictitious claims that Jesus was a Palestinian. The actor took to X, formerly known as Twitter, where she keeps her mentions restricted, perhaps for fear of being exposed for her unfounded claims and propaganda posts, and shared a picture of a couple dressed in Middle-Eastern attire and holding a baby in their hands.\n\n\u201cHappy happy birthday to the world\u2019s favourite Palestinian! #Christmas #Christmas2023 #JesusWasPalestinian\u201d Bhasker tweeted along with the picture.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, Bhasker tweeted another picture of an improvised cr\u00e8che of a baby Jesus, wrapped in a keffiyeh, lying among the rubble of broken bricks, stones and tiles. The cr\u00e8che was built at a Lutheran church in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, where Christmas celebrations are subdued over the ongoing Israel-Gaza war following the bloody pogrom by Hamas terrorists on October 7.\n\nThe image read, \u201cJesus was a Palestinian, born under occupation.\u201d\n\nSpreading such myths is quite appealing to the Islamists and their allies because it helps them deny the existence of a Jewish state, even though it existed long before Palestine came into being, and using a religious figure, revered by millions around the world, lends credence to their twisted claims.\n\nBut social media is where myths cannot hold for too long without being busted. This explains why propaganda pushers often restrict their mentions so that myth-busters can\u2019t respond to them with facts and shatter the edifice of lies they are trying to build. X, however, still allows users to quote a tweet by a user who had restricted their mentions, and respond.\n\nIn Swara\u2019s case, too, several X users descended on her timeline to quote her tweet and call her out for the lies disseminated by her.\n\n\u201cSuch delusions do not change the history,\u201d said an X user, adding, \u201cJesus was born as a Jew, which substantiates the fact that Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip traditionally belonged to the Jews.\u201d\n\nImagine these folks ridiculing others as \u201cWhatsApp University graduates\u201d. Jesus was born as a Jew, which substantiates the fact that Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip traditionally belonged to the Jews.\n\n\n\nSuch delusions do not change the history. https://t.co/Z3M181r5Qt \u2014 Brutal Truth (@sarkarstix) December 25, 2023\n\nYet another user quoted Swara\u2019s tweet and said: \u201cBimbo Jesus was a Jew who was born in the promised land Israel which was mentioned in the Bible there was never a place called Palestine. It is a geographical construct made for propaganda artists like you.\u201d\n\nBimbo Jesus was a Jew who was born in the promised land Israel which was mentioned in the Bible there was never a place called Palestine. It is a geographical construct made for propaganda artists like you. https://t.co/TYRdNu1TkH \u2014 proright (@Proright1) December 24, 2023\n\nStill, another user pithily noted that Palestine didn\u2019t even exist at the time of Jesus\u2019s birth and Jesus was born as a Jew.\n\nPalestine did not exist when Jesus was born https://t.co/0Uhy5QrSBy \u2014 Bharat (@BharatHindustn) December 25, 2023\n\nSocial media fact-checking notwithstanding, it has done little to discourage Islamist propagandists like Swara Bhasker from peddling myths like \u2018Jesus was a Palestinian\u2019 and thereby co-opt the founder of Christianity to further their tenuous claims that the modern-day Israel belonged to the Palestinians.\n\nWith Israel and Gaza at war following the bloodcurdling raids conducted by Hamas terrorists on October 7, when a large number of Gaza residents intruded into Israeli border villages and massacred people in cold blood, the attempt to appropriate Jesus and use him to advance Palestinian interests demonstrates a depravity that is the hallmark of Islamists and their sympathisers.\n\nSeveral Christian nations have been steadfastly backing Israel against its operation to stamp out Hamas from Gaza. This attempt to characterise Jesus as a Palestinian is an Islamist ploy to rally support from Christians and Christian countries and discredit Israel on its assertion that the lands historically belonged to the Jews.\n\nWhile Islamists would have us believe that Jesus is a Palestinian, the reality is starkly different. In actuality, Jesus was a proud and devout Jew, residing in his native regions of Judea and Galilee throughout his entire life \u2013 from birth to burial. The notion that Jesus was Palestinian, strategically employed to garner Christian support for Palestinian nationalism, often leads to deliberate attempts to negate the historical roots, indigenous identity, and rightful sovereignty of Jews in Israel. Ironically, at a time when combating rising antisemitism is crucial for Jews, there exists an opportunity to clarify the narrative surrounding Christianity\u2019s central figure.\n\nAccording to Christian accounts, Jesus was born into the Jewish faith and lived within a Jewish realm that encompassed much of present-day Israel, where Jews have maintained a continuous presence for 3,000 years. Luke, one of his disciples, recorded that Jesus, like other Jewish boys, underwent circumcision on the eighth day (Luke 2:21) and later participated in synagogue activities (Luke 4:16). Mark described Jesus as a rabbi (Mark 10:51), and Matthew documented that Jesus\u2019s final meal was a Passover seder (Matthew 26:17).\n\nIn essence, Jesus and the Jewish land existed long before Palestine or Islam came into existence. By this token, present-day Israel, including the West Bank and the Gaza Strip historically belong to the Jews. Yet, Islamists resort to gaslighting, manipulations, and mental gymnastics to claim that Israel is an occupying force on land traditionally belonging to them.\n\nThe ultimate Islamist goal of Dar-ul Islam: Whether it is Israel or Ram Mandir, Islamists claim their coreligionists have an implicit right to everything\n\nThere is a grotesque irony steeped in the repulsive appropriation of Jesus by the Islamists. The object of projecting Jesus as a Palestinian is to enlist the support of the Christian world for Palestine and against Israel, which they claim is illegally occupying Palestine lands. They believe their religious brethren in Palestine have a legitimate right on the Israeli lands, but they don\u2019t want to do the same when others come asking for lands forcibly and illegally occupied by their ancestors.\n\nTo that extent, Islamists claim the land in Ayodhya, where the reconstruction of a magnificent Ram Temple is underway, always belonged to Muslims because it is being built after the levelling of the Babri structure. But they don\u2019t want to admit to the evidence that points to the fact that the Babri structure was built on the ruins of a temple.\n\nSimilar is the case with the Gyanvapi mosque, whose structure still carries ample evidence to prove that it was built on the ruins of an older Shiva temple. Yet, the Islamists not only rubbish the evidence but are also against the survey of the complex, which would further cement the fact that it is built on the ruins of a temple.\n\nThis hypocrisy brings us to the ultimate Islamist goal of turning the entire world into Dar-ul-Islam or the House of Islam. They want to continue occupying the places of natives, citing \u2018democracy\u2019, \u2018rule of land\u2019, and legislations like the \u2018Places of Worship Act\u2019. But when victims like Jews reclaim Israel and Hindus reclaim Ram Mandir, the same Islamists quickly dismiss it as an \u2018illegal occupation\u2019, \u2018religious intolerance\u2019, \u2018Islamophobia\u2019, \u2018death of democracy\u2019 etc.",

The Israeli military spokesperson's office said it was looking into the report.\n\nIsrael reported the highest two-day death toll for its troops in more than a month.\n\nThe head of the Islamic Jihad militant group joined talks in Cairo, one small sign at least that diplomacy remained alive.\n\nBut in Bethlehem, the Israeli-occupied Palestinian West Bank city where Jesus Christ is believed to have been born in a stable 2,000 years ago, clergy cancelled traditional celebrations for the first time in memory.\n\n\"Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,\" Pope Francis said, presiding at Christmas Eve Mass in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n\nPalestinian Christians earlier held a Christmas vigil in Bethlehem with candle-lit hymns and prayers for peace in Gaza instead of the usual celebrations.\n\nThere was no large tree, the usual centrepiece of Bethlehem's Christmas celebrations. Nativity figurines in churches were placed amid rubble and barbed wire in solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nGet The News You Want Read market moving news with a personalized feed of stocks you care about. Get The App\n\nIn the latest massive airstrike, health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said at least 70 Palestinians were killed and several houses damaged in central Gaza's Maghazi area on Sunday night. He said many were women and children.\n\nSince a week-long truce collapsed at the start of the month, fighting has only intensified on the ground, with war spreading from the north of the Gaza Strip to the full length of the enclave.\n\n'DIFFICULT DAY'\n\nThe Israeli military said 10 of its soldiers had been killed in the past day, following five killed the previous day, its worst two-day losses since early November.\n\n\"This is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday. \"The war is exacting a very heavy cost from us; however we have no choice (but) to continue to fight.\"\n\nIn a later video message he said troops would fight on deeper into Gaza until \"total victory\" over Hamas, adding: \"We are doing everything to safeguard the lives of our warriors.\"\n\nIsrael has been under intensifying pressure in recent weeks from its closest ally the United States to scale down its military campaign and reduce civilian deaths.\n\nThe Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but blames Hamas for operating in densely populated areas or using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\n\nOn Friday, Washington withheld its veto from a U.N. Security Council resolution on the war, allowing the measure to pass after language calling for an immediate halt to hostilities was watered down.\n\nSeparate diplomatic efforts, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, on a new truce to free remaining hostages held by militants in Gaza have yielded little public progress, although Washington described the talks last week as \"very serious\".\n\nIslamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied to Hamas, said a delegation led by its exiled leader Ziad al-Nakhlala was in Cairo on Sunday. His arrival followed talks attended by Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in recent days.\n\nThe militant groups have so far said they will not discuss any release of hostages unless Israel ends its war in Gaza, while the Israelis say they are willing to discuss only a temporary pause in fighting.\n\nThe Cairo talks would centre on \"ways to end the Israeli aggression on our people\", said an Islamic Jihad official.\n\nThe delegation would reaffirm the group's position that any exchange of hostages will have to secure the release of all Palestinians jailed in Israel, \"after a ceasefire is achieved\", the official said.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad, both sworn to Israel's destruction, are still believed to be holding more than 100 hostages from among 240 they captured during their Oct. 7 rampage through Israeli towns, when they killed 1,200 people.\n\nSince then, Israel has besieged the Gaza Strip and laid much of it to waste, with more than 20,400 people confirmed killed, according to authorities in Hamas-ruled Gaza, and thousands more are believed dead under the rubble. The vast majority of the 2.3 million Gazans have been driven from their homes and the United Nations says conditions are catastrophic.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel's military chief of staff said his forces had largely achieved operational control in the north of Gaza and would expand operations further in the south.\n\nBut residents say fighting has only intensified in northern districts, notably Jabalia which Israeli forces were pounding with air strikes overnight and into Sunday. Tanks had moved further into the town on Saturday.\n\nIn the central part of the Gaza Strip, medics said six Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Bureij, where the Israeli army ordered people to evacuate and head west towards Deir Al-Balah city.\n\nJoudat Imad, 55, a father-of-six, had to leave an area in Nusseirat in central Gaza after a map published by the army marked it as a place people had to evacuate.\n\n\"I was lucky to get a tent in Rafah,\" he told Reuters by phone. \"From an owner of two buildings to a refugee in a tent awaiting aid - that is what this brutal war has turned us to.

    "articleBody": "Since October 7, Israelis have been contending with the trauma of Hamas savagery, its cynical refusal to release all the hostages abducted to Gaza and reports of IDF soldiers being killed or wounded. It is essential to destroy the ability of Hamas to govern or function, but the deeper implications of this war go far beyond the emotional and operational dimensions of Gaza and there are broader strategic questions that must be addressed well before we reach the \u2018day after\u2019 this conflict. At this time, Israel cannot limit its thinking to military actions alone, but must urgently adopt clearer policies regarding all aspects of the overall national security predicament now facing the country.\n\nIsrael is already in an operational multi-front military theater, including Gaza, the West Bank, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iranian involvement in Syria, Houthi attacks from Yemen, and not least, the ongoing Iranian nuclear program. These are considerable military threats orchestrated by Iran that demand a series of immediate policy and diplomatic responses, in parallel to the fighting in Gaza and before Israel has been able to consider fully the deeper national security implications of October 7. While the problem is rooted in the Palestinian dilemma facing Israel, it does not end there.\n\nThe present Israeli government and its predecessors over the years, have not adopted a clear and coherent policy to resolve the Palestinian problem in the belief that the conflict could be managed and contained. This belief has now been shattered by the most brutal terrorist attack against Israel in its history. The attack by Hamas on October 7 was also intended to destroy any chance of reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians, undermine the Palestinian Authority and prevent any expansion of normalization in the region between Israel and Saudi Arabia. If we now relate to all Palestinians as being Hamas supporters and reject any Palestinian control over the territories in Gaza or the West Bank (not \u201cHamastan or Fatahstan,\u201d as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put it), this will guarantee the continuation of the occupation, fulfill the Hamas objective, and deny moderate Palestinians any incentive in reaching a political compromise with Israel. In short, Hamas will achieve its goals.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority is indeed weak and needs reform and the chances of a two-state solution at present offer little hope. There is however no alternative approach that will resolve a conflict between two peoples and enable Israel to remain a democratic state with a Jewish majority. Even if a Palestinian state is not immediately feasible, the PA can provide the basis for an ongoing political process that can eventually reach understandings and mutual commitments closer to that goal. It would also provide an important signal to our friends and allies that we are not undermining this objective.\n\nCrucially, any political solution with the Palestinians after the Gaza war must incorporate substantial political, governmental, logistical, and financial support from moderate Arab states that have embraced the rationale of the Abraham Accords. The Accords can be sustained and expanded but this will require an ongoing parallel process to resolve the Palestinian problem.\n\nA Palestinian-Israeli process that includes recognition of respective national aspirations, building governmental institutions in the territories, developing an equitable economic infrastructure, and providing comprehensive health and educational facilities while ensuring Israel\u2019s legitimate security concerns, is the path to a workable political solution of coexistence in the region with the Palestinians and our Arab neighbors. This would be the ultimate defeat of Hamas.\n\nFor now, the Israeli government and the Biden Administration do not have a joint vision for a viable Palestinian solution. Israel also disagrees with its partners to the Abraham Accords (present and potential) in this respect. Any possible coalition in the region including Saudi Arabia would require a serious ongoing process leading to a two-state solution, particularly after the defeat of Hamas. This could also significantly countervail the expansion of Iran\u2019s subversion and influence through its axis of terror and will remain a vital component of regional security.\n\nIt would be a profound mistake to ignore or misinterpret President Biden\u2019s personal commitment to a two-state solution. Israeli actions that make this solution even more remote could seriously harm the immense aid and assistance we receive from America and prevent a broader coalition to ensure our joint strategic goals, particularly with respect to Iran and its axis of terror. Israel\u2019s strategic partnership with America is no less important than finding a reasonable paradigm for living alongside the Palestinians.\n\nA policy realignment by Israel with America and moderate Arab states could provide an essential basis for a coalition to deal with the immense challenge of restructuring Gaza, creating a partnership with a moderate Palestinian leadership, formulating a broader response to Hezbollah in the north, reversing Iranian involvement in Syria, neutralizing the Houthi threat in the Red Sea, and rolling back the Iranian nuclear program. These are substantial regional threats that equally endanger moderate Arab neighbors and American interests. These challenges do not and should not rest on Israeli shoulders alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe strategic threat that Iran posed before 7 October has increased and the Iranian nuclear program has never been as advanced as it is now. Iran\u2019s higher levels of enriched uranium place it closer to acquiring a military nuclear option in a much shorter timeframe. Urgent international efforts are therefore needed to deter Iran from crossing the nuclear threshold, proliferating more missiles and drones and manipulating its proxies in the region. Iran\u2019s efforts are part of an overall strategy that will work against any moderation and stability in the region.\n\nPresident Biden said during his visit to Israel soon after October 7, that \u201cwhile you feel that rage do not be consumed by it.\u201d In the final analysis, Israeli anger will not vanish anytime soon, but Israel must now take some clear decisions regarding next steps with the Palestinians in the context of broader regional threats. It could be crucial in consolidating American and European support in defeating Hamas in a reasonable operational timeline. It could also provide a political horizon to help forge a viable Israeli Palestinian process to underwrite the regional coalition needed to address the evolving humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of October 7. This could be the opportunity this crisis needs.",

    "articleBody": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Ahead of a likely vote on Thursday, the United States said there are \"serious and widespread concerns\" that the current draft of a U.N. Security Council proposal that aims to boost humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip could actually slow down deliveries.\n\nLast-minute negotiations continued on Thursday to try to avoid a U.S. veto of the resolution, drafted by the United Arab Emirates, that would demand that Israel and Hamas allow and facilitate \"the use of all land, sea and air routes to and throughout the entire Gaza\" for humanitarian aid deliveries.\n\n\"We're not there yet,\" deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood told reporters on Thursday.\n\nA key sticking point is a proposal for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to establish a monitoring mechanism in Gaza \"to exclusively monitor all humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza provided through land, sea and air routes of those States that are not parties to the conflict.\"\n\nThis would dilute Israel's control over all aid deliveries to 2.3 million people in Gaza. Currently Israel monitors the limited aid and fuel deliveries to Gaza via the Rafah crossing from Egypt and the Israel-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing.\n\n\"There are still serious and widespread concerns that this resolution as drafted could actually slow down delivery of humanitarian aid,\" said Nate Evans, spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations on Thursday. \"We must ensure any resolution helps and doesn't hurt the situation on the ground.\"\n\nNorwegian Refugee Council Secretary General Jan Egeland, who was the U.N. aid chief from 2003-06, disagreed with the U.S. view and said Gaza aid monitoring should not remain in the hands of Israel because it is party to the conflict.\n\n\"It is categorically wrong to say that the U.N. monitoring mechanism would slow down aid,\" said Egeland, adding that he wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken within days of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel to push for a third party aid monitoring mechanism, led by the U.N., U.S. or European Union.\n\nIsrael has retaliated against Hamas for the Oct. 7 attacks by bombarding Gaza from the air, imposing a siege and launching a ground offensive. Nearly 20,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to health officials in Hamas-ruled Gaza.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric declined to comment on the aid monitoring proposal on Thursday.\n\nHe told reporters on Wednesday: \"The Secretary-General's own position is unchanged. He's been calling for a humanitarian ceasefire and also he's been calling for the creation of the conditions on the ground to be conducive for broader delivery of humanitarian aid.\"\n\nWashington traditionally shields its ally Israel from U.N. action and has already twice vetoed Security Council action since an Oct. 7 attack that Israel says killed 1,200 people and saw 240 people taken hostage.\n\nThe U.S. is also wary of a reference in the draft resolution to a cessation of hostilities, said diplomats. The U.S. and Israel oppose a ceasefire, believing it would only benefit Hamas. Washington instead supports pauses in fighting to protect civilians and free hostages taken by Hamas.\n\nMost people in Gaza have been driven from their homes and U.N. officials have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe. The World Food Programme says half of Gaza's population is starving and only 10% of the food required has entered Gaza since Oct. 7.\n\nEarlier this month the 193-member U.N. General Assembly demanded a humanitarian ceasefire, with 153 states voting in favor of the move that had been vetoed by the United States in the Security Council days earlier.\n\n(Reporting by Michelle Nichols; editing by Paul Grant and Alistair Bell)\n\nBy Michelle Nichols",

    "articleBody": "This article first appeared in Capital, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on December 18, 2023 - December 24, 2023\n\nBUOYED by expectations of interest rate cuts, a weakening of the US dollar and a geopolitical premium, experts anticipate a continuing uptrend in the price of gold in 2024, even if inflation eases. On Dec 4, the precious metal hit an all-time high of US$2,135 an ounce, hovering above the previous record of US$2,072 an ounce in August 2020 before falling later that morning to trade at US$2,023 an ounce.\n\nThe high came as investors grew increasingly confident in recent weeks that the US Federal Reserve had successfully reined in inflation through an aggressive rate hike cycle, which saw interest rates raised to a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% since July, and may begin cutting rates as early as March next year. Analysts anticipate four cuts to the US federal funds rate in 2024.\n\nThree days later, however, gold reversed its gains following fresh inflation data, slipping 0.1% to US$1,979.99 an ounce amid concerns that inflation has been taking longer to return to the Fed\u2019s 2% target, raising the possibility that the central bank will keep policy rates in restrictive territory longer than anticipated.\n\nFollowing the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting last Wednesday, the central bank kept the target range for the fed funds rate at 5.25% to 5.5%, confirming broad expectations, but signalled three rate cuts in 2024 instead of four, as anticipated by investors.\n\nOfficials see the Fed keeping monetary policy tighter than expected, with the median forecast in FOMC members\u2019 latest Summary of Economic Projections showing that the fed funds rate will end 2024 at 4.6%.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision affirms OANDA Asia Pacific Pte Ltd senior market analyst Kelvin Wong\u2019s belief that the central bank will adopt a \u201cdovish pause\u201d for now and be ready to cut interest rates only when key economic data such as services activities start to slow down.\n\n\u201cAll in all, US weakness is likely to extend into 2024. And if the Israel-Hamas conflict worsens and starts to trigger instability in the Middle East, the geopolitical war premium is likely to increase and may lead to a positive impact on gold prices,\u201d he tells The Edge.\n\nSimilarly, BMI Research, a unit of Fitch Solutions, in its Country Risk & Industry Research note on Nov 28, spelt its expectation that in 2024, investor flows into gold will fuel demand amid global growth slowing from 2.6% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024, a further weakening in the greenback (with a 50% probability of a shallow recession in the US) and as the Fed starts to cut interest rates. The UK-based research firm maintained its 2023 and 2024 gold price forecasts at US$1,950 an ounce, expecting prices to trade within the range of US$1,900 to US$2,000 an ounce in the coming months, with strong upside risks towards the second half of 2024 undergirded by the factors mentioned earlier.\n\n\u201cIn the longer term, we expect gold prices to remain elevated in the coming years compared to pre-Covid levels,\u201d says BMI. It also foresees that spot gold (XAU/USD), which is spot gold traded on the foreign exchange market, is likely to evolve in a \u201cbullish environment\u201d in 2024.\n\nTo this end, BMI projects that global gold mine production will grow strongly in 2023 and 2024, owing to the higher prices. \u201cOver the medium term from 2023 to 2027, global mine production growth will remain strong, as the high prices by historical standards [will] encourage investment and output.\n\n\u201c[Thus,] we expect global gold production to increase from 107 million ounces in 2023 to 134 million ounces by 2032. This would be an acceleration from the average growth of just 0.8% over the 2016-2020 period.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, local jeweller Habib Jewels Sdn Bhd managing director Datuk Seri Meer Habib observes that high inflation since the pandemic started in 2020 has fuelled consumers\u2019 demand for gold in Malaysia. He recalls that there was a surge in the company\u2019s gold sales following the government\u2019s approval for Employees Provident Fund contributors to withdraw up to RM10,000 from their accounts in March 2022.\n\n\u201cMany people bought gold, as it is the best hedge against inflation. The demand for gold has had a significant impact on us industry players [indicating the profit-taking reflected in the trajectory of gold prices this year] \u2014 although this year, EPF contributors who drew down the RM10,000 had exhausted their cash, resulting in lower sales at the start of 2023 compared with the same period last year. Nevertheless, our year-end gold sales are picking up, as the prospects of investing in gold are increasing,\u201d says Meer, who believes gold could hit US$2,200 to US$2,400 an ounce by end-2024.\n\nSpot gold could hit US$2,330 in 2024\n\nAs for how much upside gold prices will have next year, OANDA\u2019s Wong forecasts that the second major resistance for spot gold stands at US$2,330, after US$2,250, which offers an upside potential of 17% from the current price of US$1,985 (as at last Tuesday, Dec 12).\n\nThe projections of further upside will depend on two primary factors, beginning with the lower 10-year US Treasury real yield heading into 2024, he explains. \u201cThis will be the case for at least the first half of 2024, owing to the current easing trajectory of global inflationary pressures that increase the odds of a first Fed rate cut at the March 2024 FOMC meeting which, in turn, will reduce the \u2018opportunity cost\u2019 of holding gold,\u201d he predicts.\n\n\u201cSecond, a rising gold/copper ratio, which has been in play since June 2022, suggests an increasing likelihood of a global recession in 2024. That also advocates for a potential bullish outlook for gold prices.\u201d\n\nAs investors will want to know whether the current medium-term uptrend will be sustainable after a rally that saw spot gold rising 18% from a low of US$1,833.01 on Oct 6 this year, OANDA sees an increasing risk of a global recession, which in turn may allow the current medium-term uptrend phase of spot gold to remain intact via its portfolio hedging role.\n\n\u201cUsing an intermarket analysis approach, the medium-term uptrend phase low of Oct 6, 2023, seen in spot gold has coincided closely with the recent softness of the 10-year US Treasury real yield, as it has declined by 47 basis points from 2.47% printed on Oct 6, 2023.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the 10-year US breakeven rate (market-based implied US inflation rate 10 years from today) is looking vulnerable for a bearish breakdown below 2.10%, suggesting that the 10-year US Treasury real yield still has room for further downside potential that, in turn, lowers the opportunity cost of holding gold,\u201d says Wong, adding that the technical reading of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 against spot gold shows that a US recession is imminent.\n\nHaving said that, he cautions that expectations of cuts to the fed funds rate in 2024 risk being dialled back.\u201cThe monthly growth of the number of jobs added in the US labour market has continued to tread lower for the second consecutive month and below the 12-month average monthly gain of 240,000. But the slowdown was not as severe as expected in November as the unemployment rate also dipped to 3.7% from 3.9% in October,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cOverall, the US labour market is still indicating a soft-landing scenario for the [nation\u2019s] economy, which in turn may force market participants to reduce their high expectations of four fed funds rate cuts totalling 100 basis points. Those are based on the current fed funds rate futures data as calculated by the CME FedWatch Tool. Also, it is twice the amount of rate cuts projected in 2024 as indicated by the last Fed officials\u2019 dot plot forecasts released in September\u2019s FOMC meeting.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, other commodities expected to drive the commodity market next year could include industrial metals such as copper, as its price movement has a strong direct correlation with the growth prospects in China, says Wong.\n\n\u201cThe heightened risk of a deflationary spiral remains sticky in China, owing to the chronic weakness seen in the property market, which may put pressure on China\u2019s top policymakers to make a shift away from the current targeted approach by adopting more broad-based stimulus measures, coupled with structural moves to remove bad assets from property developers\u2019 balances to negate the deflationary risk. Such moves in turn may trigger a positive feedback loop into copper prices after trading almost flat in 2023,\u201d he surmises.\n\nSave by subscribing to us for your print and/or digital copy.",

    "articleBody": "Tel Aviv \u2014 Throughout the war in Gaza, Israel's military has spoken frequently of the challenges presented by the vast tunnel network the Hamas militant group built underneath the Palestinian territory. Israel says Hamas, long designated a terror group by the U.S., Israel and many other nations, has used the tunnels to transport supplies and carry out attacks \u2014 including its unprecedented Oct. 7 assault, which sparked the current war.\n\nOn Friday, CBS News was escorted by Israel Defense Forces troops through the gap blasted by Hamas militants on Oct. 7 in the wall protecting the Erez border crossing into Gaza. All along the road was destruction wrought by the Hamas militants as they went to carry out their murderous rampage.\n\nThis picture taken during a media tour organized by the Israeli military on Dec. 15, 2023, shows the damage to the Erez border crossing between southern Israel and the Gaza Strip after the attack by Hamas on Oct. 7. JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty\n\nSince that day, the Erez crossing has become part of a deeply complex war zone. Israeli forces come in and out through the gap in the wall, carrying out ground operations in the Gaza Strip as they continue to hunt down Hamas militants.\n\nOnly about 500 yards inside the border, Israeli forces made a shocking discovery. Virtually right under their noses, they found the entrance to a huge tunnel, about two miles long and wide enough to drive a small car through. Water supply pipes and electricity and communication wires lined the walls.\n\nMade with reinforced concrete and plunging more than 50 feet underground, the IDF said it was a major part of a vast tunnel network used by Hamas militants to hide weapons and to move and hold its hostages.\n\nAn Israeli soldier secures a tunnel near the border with Israel on December 15, 2023 in northern Gaza Strip. AMIR LEVY/Getty\n\nEven for the Israeli forces, who've known for years about Hamas' tunnels, the scale of the illicit infrastructure discovered so close to the Israeli border was an unpleasant surprise.\n\n\"This is the biggest tunnel that we found ever,\" IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari told CBS News inside the tunnel. He said it was indicative of the complexities of the IDF's mission to rescue the roughly 130 people still believed to be captive in Gaza, while also hunting down the Hamas fighters who kidnapped them.\n\n\"It means hunting them down and fighting them wherever they are \u2014 inside the tunnels and above the ground,\" Hagari told CBS News.\n\nThat, inevitably, carries risk for the people still believed to be held hostage in Gaza.\n\n\"I think we are managing the risk,\" Hagari said. \"Remember that rescuing our hostages \u2014 we want to bring out hostages alive, back home. It's very complex. We want them alive, back home.\"\n\nLater that day, the IDF acknowledged that some of its soldiers had mistakenly shot dead three Israeli hostages who emerged \u2014 shirtless and holding up a white flag \u2014 during an operation in Gaza, raising not only fear for the remaining captives, but also serious questions, including why the troops had fired on unarmed men in the first place.",

A new Late Late host\n\nPatrick Kielty pokes fun at Late Late show controversy in opening monologue\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the RT\u00c9 payments scandal, Patrick Kielty took over as host of The Late Late Show on September 15. The veteran stand-up comedian had big shoes to fill, succeeding Gay Byrne, Pat Kenny and Ryan Tubridy. However, he immediately endeared himself to viewers with a funny and heartfelt opening monologue. Since then, Kielty has repeatedly risen to the occasion. Following the beginning of the Israel-Palestine war, he recalled his experiences growing up in a conflict zone and noted that the people of Ireland are \u201cliving our own miracle\u201d. He then addressed those caught up in the conflict and expressed the hope that \u201cyour miracle comes soon\u201d. Kielty also proved a hit on The Late Late Toy Show, with more than 1.7 million viewers tuning in.\n\n2. Sinead Farrelly\u2019s call-up\n\nSinead Farrelly was called up to the Republic of Ireland women\u2019s soccer squad for the first time in April. Any call-up is momentous but, for Farrelly, it carried extra poignancy. The American had not played competitively in eight years. Injuries sustained in a car accident in 2015 forced her into early retirement. In 2021, she made allegations of sexual coercion against a former coach, a disclosure that prompted a wider investigation into abuse in US women\u2019s soccer. After making tentative steps back into soccer this year, Farrelly made her debut for the Republic of Ireland in April. She later played a key role in the World Cup, an experience that was life-changing. \u201cSince I\u2019ve come back, I\u2019ve felt such a shift,\u201d she told Fifa. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve been struggling physically, I\u2019ve felt so much joy.\u201d\n\n3. Ireland win Grand Slam\n\nIreland's Johnny Sexton and Andy Farrell speak after defeat to New Zealand\n\nIt was a St Patrick\u2019s weekend to remember as Ireland won the Six Nations in decisive fashion. Having racked up wins against France, Scotland, Wales and Italy, Ireland faced England in the Aviva Stadium on March 18. After a rocky start, Ireland recorded a 26-19 win over the old enemy to clinch the Grand Slam and Triple Crown. To make it even sweeter, it was Ireland\u2019s first time winning the Six Nations on home soil since 1948. It was also Johnny Sexton\u2019s final ever Six Nations match. He went out on a high, becoming the leading points scorer in Six Nations history and breaking a record previously set by Ronan O\u2019Gara.\n\n4. Paul Lynch wins Booker Prize\n\nIrish Booker Prize winner Paul Lynch 'astonished' by Dublin disturbances\n\nIn November, Paul Lynch became the sixth Irish author to win the prestigious Booker Prize for his novel, Prophet Song. The book, which imagines an Ireland under totalitarian rule, was described by Esi Edugyan, chair of judges, as \u201ca triumph of emotional storytelling, bracing and brave\u201d. She added that readers would \u201cnot soon forget its warnings\u201d. Lynch received a \u00a350,000 prize for his efforts while sales of Prophet Song surged following his win. It was a standout year for Irish authors, with Paul Murray also making the shortlist for his novel, The Bee Sting. Sebastian Barry and Elaine Feeney were also long-listed for their novels, Old God\u2019s Time and How To Build a Boat.\n\n5. Aisling Hanly\u2019s All-Ireland win\n\nAisling Hanly\n\nBack in March, Aisling Hanly captained her school, Convent of Mercy in Co Roscommon, to an All-Ireland in ladies\u2019 football, scoring the winning goal. It was a feat made all the more impressive by the fact that Hanly, who was born profoundly deaf, wears two cochlear implants. Indeed, she wears a rugby scrum cap during match play to protect her implants. After speaking openly about her disability, Hanly was hailed as an inspiration both on and off the pitch. \u201cI don\u2019t let it bother me at all, and it shouldn\u2019t bother anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cSport is a great way to get out, make friends and become more confident in yourself.\u201d\n\n6.

Born in Wicklow, he moved to California at the age of 13. After picking up American football, he played as a punter with UC Davis and spent a season in the XFL, an American football minor league, before being signed up by the iconic Green Bay Packers this summer. After making his league debut in September, he became the first Irish-born player to feature in an NFL game since 1985. So far, he has made a strong start. Come on you boys in Green Bay!\n\n7. The unstoppable rise of Rhasidat Adeleke\n\nThe rise of Rhasidat Adeleke: The inside track from Texas\n\nAthlete Rhasidat Adeleke continued her remarkable run this year, becoming the first Irish sprinter to win an outdoor NCAA title. The Tallaght native claimed a 8. remarkable win in the 400m at this year\u2019s NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, a year-end competition featuring elite collegiate athletes from across the United States. Adeleke ran 49.20, winning a gold medal for University of Texas and setting a new Irish record. In July, Adeleke announced she was going professional and signed a contract with Nike. The following month, she finished just outside the medals at the World Athletics Championships, securing an agonising fourth place finish. Next up? Paris 2024, where all eyes will be on the 21-year-old.\n\n8. When love conquered fear\n\nIreland For All march\n\nOn February 18, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Dublin to take part in the Ireland For All march. The march, which was organised by Le Ch\u00e9ile in response to a number of anti-immigrant protests, saw people march in solidarity with refugees and affirm Ireland\u2019s commitment to welcoming migrants. Musician Christy Moore performed at the protest and told the crowd that \u201cwe are stronger when we are together\u201d and added that he was there to express \u201crevulsion\u201d at \u201cthe hatred and violence expressed by a small number of people\u201d. Activist Ailbhe Smyth echoed this sentiment and said, \u201cWe have come together to celebrate that fabulous rich variety and diversity that is Ireland today.\u201d A reminder that love conquers fear.\n\n9.

The youngster undertook the exam to raise awareness for the plight of disabled children in Ireland and their families. Cara\u2019s two younger brothers both have autism and she has campaigned extensively for improved services for children with special needs, even meeting with senior politicians to lobby for change and calling on the Government to fund private assessments for children on waiting lists.

Dubliner Se\u00e1n McGirr lands fashion\u2019s top job\n\nDublin designer Se\u00e1n McGirr landed one of the most illustrious gigs in fashion after he was named creative director of Alexander McQueen in October. McGirr succeeded Sarah Burton and is only the second creative director to helm the brand since its founder died in 2010. McGirr, who studied at Central St Martins, previously oversaw ready-to-wear at JW Anderson and has worked with other heavyweight brands like Dries Van Noten, Uniqlo and Burberry. Speaking about his appointment, the brand\u2019s CEO, Gianfilippo Testa, hailed McGirr\u2019s \u201cexperience, personality, and creative energy\u201d and stated he would bring a \u201cpowerful creative language to Alexander McQueen while building on its unique heritage\u201d.\n\n12. Youngest party leader steps up\n\nHolly Cairns in Profile\n\nIn March, Holly Cairns became the leader of the Social Democrats after party founders Catherine Murphy and R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall announced they were stepping down as co-leaders. In doing so, the Cork South-West TD became the youngest party leader in the country at the age of just 33. In her maiden speech as party leader, Cairns outlined her own extraordinary journey from grassroots activist to party leader and memorably described herself as \u201ca member of the first generation who will be worse off than our parents\u201d. The speech resonated and was viewed hundreds of thousands of times on social media, marking the arrival of a new voice in Irish politics.\n\n13. First Irish female tops the charts in 14 years\n\nJazzy\n\nOne of the breakout stars of 2023 was Jazzy. The Crumlin woman became the first Irish female artist to enjoy a number-one single in Ireland in 14 years when her smash hit Giving Me topped the charts in May. The song additionally went gold in the UK, peaking at number three and earning a shout-out from Calvin Harris, who described it as a \u201cbanger\u201d. Did we mention it\u2019s been streamed more than 100 million times on Spotify? It\u2019s something of a fairytale rise for Jazzy who was working in a bakery in Tesco until last year and credits the free violin lessons she received in primary school with inspiring her to pursue music. Expect more bangers and bops from this star in the making.\n\n14. Katie Taylor defies the odds\n\nKatie Taylor\n\nBack in May, Katie Taylor lost her first ever fight to Chantelle Cameron. Six months later, Taylor and Cameron returned to Dublin\u2019s 3Arena for a highly anticipated rematch. The stakes could not have been higher for the 37-year-old boxer with a loss threatening to end her career and a win allowing her to reclaim her undisputed title. Taylor entered the November 25 fight as the underdog, with many observers favouring her opponent. Thanks to her signature steel and determination, however, she defied the odds and won the fight by majority decision, becoming a two-weight world champion. \u201cWhoever wrote me off obviously don\u2019t know me very well,\u201d she said afterwards. \u201cDon\u2019t ever doubt me.\u201d And who would?\n\n15. Barbenheimer rescues Irish cinema\n\nCillian Murphy\n\nBarbenheimer was the cinematic event of the year and was credited with single-handedly bringing back event cinema. To recap, both Barbie and Oppenheimer were released on July 21 and resulted in Irish cinemas taking in more than \u20ac3.93m during opening weekend as cinemagoers ventured out in their droves to see the two blockbusters \u2014 some even attending both films back to back. Barbie went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Ireland, while the Cillian Murphy-led Oppenheimer surpassed An Cail\u00edn Ci\u00fain to become the highest grossing film for the IFI. The result? Cinemas that have struggled since the pandemic enjoyed a mighty jolt while film fans were treated to two of the films of the year. Win-win.\n\n16. An Cail\u00edn Ci\u00fain makes history\n\nExclusive Interview with Director and Producer of An Cailin Ciulin\n\nIn what was viewed as a groundbreaking moment for Irish language cinema, An Cail\u00edn Ci\u00fain made history by becoming the first ever Irish language film to be nominated for Best International Film at the Academy Awards back in January. It was nominated alongside Close (Belgium), EO (Poland), Argentina 1985 (Argentina) and the eventual winner, All Quiet on the Western Front (Germany). Director Colm Bair\u00e9ad and producer Cleona N\u00ed Chrualao\u00ed described the nomination as \u201ca truly historic and meaningful moment for Irish film, the Irish people and the Irish language\u201d. Having grossed more than \u20ac1m at the Irish box office, An Cail\u00edn Ci\u00fain has since earned nearly \u20ac5.9m worldwide, enjoying releases in Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy, Australia and many other territories.\n\n17. Buy Caio Benicio a pint\n\nCaio Benicio\n\nFollowing the horrific knife attack in Parnell Square on November 23, Irish people united to honour the heroic actions of Caio Benicio. The Brazilian delivery rider was credited with acting quickly and tackling the assailant, preventing any further casualties. In response, a fundraiser titled \u2018Buy Caio Benicio a Pint\u2019 was set up on GoFundMe and raised nearly \u20ac370,000. Benicio later revealed that he was overwhelmed with the support but expressed gratitude. \u201cYes, I speak a different language. Yes, I have an accent. But I love [it] here so much that I would defend this country like a true Irishman would!\u201d\n\n18. Sexton\u2019s \u2018best dad\u2019 moment\n\nJohnny Sexton\n\nJohnny Sexton, one of Ireland\u2019s greatest ever rugby players, hung up his boots after this year\u2019s Rugby World Cup. While the tournament didn\u2019t quite go to plan for Sexton or his teammates, there was a special on-field moment in October that tugged at the heartstrings of viewers at home. As Sexton walked around the pitch and processed the team\u2019s heartbreaking quarter-final loss to New Zealand, his son, Luca, sought to comfort him and told him, \u201cYou\u2019re still the best dad\u201d before offering his old man a hug. The gorgeous interaction was captured by cameras and served to remind fans of what really matters.\n\n19. An Irish happy birthday at Oscars\n\nAn Irish Goodbye\n\nOne of the most joyous, life-affirming moments at this year\u2019s Academy Awards on March 13 came when the team behind An Irish Goodbye won the Oscar for Best Live Action Short. During their acceptance speech, the film\u2019s co-directors, Ross White and Tom Berkeley, decided to cede the spotlight and encouraged the entire Dolby Theatre to sing Happy Birthday to the film\u2019s star, James Martin, who turned 31 that day. Martin, who has Down syndrome, was delighted as everyone from Colin Farrell to Janelle Mon\u00e1e joined in the singalong. As for where he celebrated the rest of his birthday? At Elton John\u2019s after-party, naturally.\n\n20. Daniel Wiffen breaks world record\n\nDaniel Wiffen\n\nOn December 10, Daniel Wiffen became the first Irish swimmer to break a world record in the pool. The Co Down man set the short course record in the 800m freestyle at the European Championships, smashing the mark set by Australian swimmer Grant Hackett 15 years earlier. It was a magnificent milestone to end an extraordinary year, which saw Wiffen win international medals and break other records. He was honoured with a Swim Ireland Award for Performance Athlete of the Year (Swimming). Paris 2024 now beckons with Wiffen among Ireland\u2019s most exciting medal prospects. Remember the name.\n\n21. Potus\u2019s shout-out to baby Margot\n\nJoe Biden with baby Margot Moynihan\n\nDuring his trip to Ireland in April, US president Joe Biden\u2019s most adorable meeting came during his visit to Leinster House, when he came face to face with eight-week-old Margot Moynihan Roantree, the daughter of Senator Rebecca Moynihan. Moynihan attended Biden\u2019s address with her baby in tow, with Margot earning a shout-out from Potus. \u201cI apologise to you, little baby girl,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea you\u2019re subjected to hearing the president of the United States deliver a policy speech is as bad as what all my children had been put through.\u201d Biden made it up to Margot by posing for a photo with her afterwards. One for the mantlepiece.\n\n22. Eighty-three-year-old knitter gets the world\u2019s attention\n\nDelia Barry, an 83-year-old from Greystones, Co Wicklow, became an unlikely sensation after her knitwear was featured in The Banshees of Inisherin. A lifelong knitter, Barry was asked by the film\u2019s costume designer, Eimer N\u00ed Mhaoldomhnaigh, to create jumpers for the film\u2019s cast, including Colin Farrell. With no patterns to work off, she studied vintage photographs of fishermen to get inspiration for some of the film\u2019s knitwear. Barry\u2019s creations attracted international attention from the likes of The New York Times, Vanity Fair and the BBC. Speaking of finding fame at 83, she told The New York Times: \u201cBecause you get older, it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not useful anymore. There\u2019s a lot we can do, if we want to.\u201d\n\n23. Paul Mescal speaks Irish\n\nPaul Mescal impresses with impromptu red carpet interview as Gaeilge at the Baftas\n\nIs there anything Paul Mescal can\u2019t do? This year saw the Maynooth actor earn his first Academy Award nomination, win an Olivier Award and land a role in the highly anticipated sequel to Gladiator. His greatest achievement, though? Dusting off the c\u00fapla focal. At the Bafta Awards in February, he flew the flag for the Irish language when he did a red-carpet interview as Gaeilge with TG4. Mescal, who attended a Gaelscoil primary school, impressed viewers with his warm embrace of the Irish language. It was viewed 3.5 million times on X, formerly Twitter, and was even covered in The New York Times. As if we needed more reasons to be proud of him.\n\n24. John Creedon\u2019s tribute to Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\n\nFollowing the tragic and untimely death of Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor, John Creedon decided to pay tribute to her by devoting his entire RT\u00c9 Radio One show on July 26 to the singer, playing hits from her back catalogue and sharing reminiscences. The show was likened to something of a musical wake, with fans from all over tuning in to pay their respects to one of our greatest musicians. Creedon was widely praised for striking the exact right tone as people grieved a great cultural loss. It was a reminder of the power and immediacy of radio as well as of the importance of public service broadcasting.\n\n25. Lankum nominated for Mercury Music Prize\n\nLankum\n\nLankum, the Irish contemporary folk quartet, were nominated for the Mercury Music Prize this year for their album, False Lankum. Widely regarded as one of the most prestigious awards in British and Irish music, Lankum were among 12 acts to be included on this year\u2019s shortlist. Fellow nominees included Arctic Monkeys, Fred Again and Jessie Ware. Previous Irish nominees include U2, R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy, Fontaines DC, Lisa Hannigan and Jessie Buckley. At the ceremony on July 27, Lankum performed a stirring rendition of Go Dig My Grave. Ultimately, the group lost out on the prize to Ezra Collective, meaning Ireland\u2019s wait for a Mercury Prize continues. However, False Lankum continues to make waves.\n\n26. Weightlifter Thammy Nguyen wins medal\n\nThammy Nguyen\n\nThammy Nguyen became the first Irish athlete to win a medal at the European Weightlifting Championships when she secured a bronze medal in the 49kg in April. Nguyen, who was born in Vietnam and moved to Ireland as a small child, had previously competed in weightlifting. She stepped away from the sport and got married, had two children and started a number of businesses with her husband. When her brother, Nhat Nguyen, represented Ireland in badminton at the Tokyo Olympics, she was inspired to get back into weightlifting. Now the 4\u201910 powerhouse is eyeing qualification for Paris 2024. And you wouldn\u2019t bet against her.\n\n27. Ferguson on track to become \u00a3100m player\n\nEvan Ferguson\n\nFew people had a better 2023 than Evan Ferguson. The 19-year-old had a fantastic season with his club, Brighton & Hove Albion, and was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year in August alongside the likes of Bukayo Saka and Erling Haaland. He later signed a contract extension, keeping him at Brighton until 2029, and his performances have fuelled speculation that he could become a \u00a3100m player. Elsewhere, Ferguson netted his first ever goal for the Republic of Ireland. His greatest accomplishment, though? Passing his driving test. \u201cI haven\u2019t sweated as much in a match as I did during that driving test I don\u2019t think,\u201d he said. \u201cNever again!\u201d\n\n28. Rare orchids at Trinity\n\nOrchid\n\nThis year, Trinity College participated in No Mow May, a biodiversity initiative that encourages people to refrain from cutting the grass for a month to help native wildlife. The front lawn was transformed into a gorgeous wildflower meadow for the month, with flowers blooming and pollinating insects reaping the rewards. Over the course of the month, chair of botany Jenny McElwain spotted a rare orchid known as a broad-leaved helleborine growing under a tree, prompting Trinity College to extend its no-mow policy through June. More than 30 species of flower popped up through the soil during the two-month experiment, including a second orchid. As professor Jane Stout explained, it\u2019s proof that \u201cnature can persist and recover\u201d if given adequate space and time.\n\n29. Fan Fionn McGivern\n\nFionn McGivern\n\nOne of the most unforgettable photos of the summer was that of two-year-old Fionn McGivern. The picture, snapped by James Crombie for INPHO, shows Fionn standing alone in the stairway of the stands in Croke Park with his hands behind his back, utterly engrossed in the All-Ireland hurling semi-final between Kilkenny and Clare. \u201cAll week, he\u2019s been shouting, \u2018Come on the Cats,\u2019\u201d his father told the Belfast Telegraph. The photo was viewed more than 3.5 million times on social media platform X.\n\n30. Deaf barrister Sofiya Kalinova\n\nSofiya Kalinova broke new ground by becoming the first deaf person to qualify as a barrister in Ireland. A graduate of UCD and the King\u2019s Inns, Kalinova was called to the Bar in October by Chief Justice Donal O\u2019Donnell. She is the first barrister to practise law in Irish Sign Language (ISL). Originally from Bulgaria, Kalinova completed her studies and exams in spoken English and ISL, neither of which are her first languages. Writing on LinkedIn, Kalinova said that her achievement not only represented a \u201cpersonal triumph\u201d but \u201cadvances inclusivity and diversity in the legal profession\u201d. She added, \u201cLet\u2019s keep breaking down barriers and making strides together.\u201d\n\n31. Recognition for Irish beef and Achill salt\n\nAchill Sea Salt\n\nIn November, two Irish food products received special recognition and protection by the EU. Irish grass-fed beef was awarded Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status, while Achill Island Sea Salt received Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status. They\u2019re in good company as these prestigious designations have previously been bestowed on the likes of French champagne, Greek feta cheese, English Stilton cheese and Italian parma ham. Ireland has a number of registered PDO/PGI food product names, including Clare Island salmon, Imokilly Regato and Timoleague brown pudding. Anyone else feeling peckish?\n\n32. First dementia-inclusive shopping centre\n\nMahon Point\n\nWith more than 64,000 people living with dementia in Ireland, it\u2019s becoming more and more important to create spaces that are dementia-friendly. In November, Mahon Point Shopping Centre in Co Cork became Ireland\u2019s first dementia-inclusive shopping centre. The shopping centre partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on the initiative, which saw retail staff undergo dementia-inclusive training to help make the shopping centre a warm and welcoming environment for shoppers with dementia and their families. Bravo.\n\n33. Dolly Parton chats to Liveline\n\nDolly Parton\n\nWho had \u2018Dolly Parton appears on Liveline\u2019 on their bingo card this year? In October, the Queen of Country made a surprise appearance on the RT\u00c9 Radio 1 show, chatting to Katie Hannon about everything from her career to child literacy. She recounted her trip to Co Kerry in 1990, during which she ended up performing in P\u00e1idi \u00d3 S\u00e9\u2019s pub in Ventry. \u00d3 S\u00e9 gifted Parton his jersey, which she revealed is framed and has pride of place in her basement. She additionally thanked a group of women in Co Kerry who dressed up as her for a Guinness World Record attempt. \u201cI\u2019m proud of all of you \u2014 you made me proud.\u201d Come back any time, Dolly.\n\n34. Charlie Bird meets Bruce Springsteen\n\nCharlie Bird with Bruce Springsteen\n\nIn May, Charlie Bird got to fulfil a dream when he met with Bruce Springsteen backstage at his RDS show. The veteran journalist, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2021, spoke with Springsteen using a digital speech app and got to exchange a few hugs with his musical hero. Springsteen\u2019s kindness didn\u2019t end there either. On stage, he dedicated the song Land of Hope and Dreams to Bird, prompting a standing ovation from the Dublin crowd. Bird later described the meeting as \u201ca magical moment\u201d. \u201cOh God, Bruce is a great human,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cMy final wish has happened.\u201d\n\n35. Irish woman returns artefacts\n\nArtefacts\n\nIn recent years, there has been a movement around repatriating historical artefacts. This year, a Limerick woman was inspired by an article she read online to return her late father\u2019s collection of Aboriginal and African objects to their countries of origin, as per his wishes. The collection includes beautifully crafted wooden clubs, shields, harpoons and more. Walsh got in touch with Dr Christos Tsirogiannis, a lecturer in archaeology at the University of Cambridge, who offered guidance, and she is now in the process of returning the objects to South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan and Australia. An official from the South African embassy expressed gratitude, telling Walsh that it was \u201ca lovely gesture\u201d.\n\n36. Ciara Mageean on track for success\n\nCiara Mageean holding her head high after finishing fourth in the 1500 world final\n\nCiara Mageean enjoyed a banner year on the track. In May, she reclaimed the Irish 800m record with a time of 1:59.27. Less than two months later, she set a new national record over the one-mile distance, breaking a mark previously set by none other than Sonia O\u2019Sullivan. In August, she broke her own 1,500m record when she came fourth at the World Athletics Championships in a race widely considered to be the greatest 1,500m women\u2019s race of all time. Weeks later, she smashed that same record yet again during a Diamond League event with a time of 3:55.87. The Portaferry woman now holds national records over four distances, confirming her status as one of Ireland\u2019s greatest athletes. Bring on 2024.\n\n37. League of Ireland\n\nThis year saw Irish fans attend domestic soccer games in their droves, with the League of Ireland experiencing a rise in attendance figures. A huge 135,000 more people attended games across the Premier Division, First Division and Women\u2019s Division this season compared to 2022, an increase of 20pc. The season culminated with 43,881 fans attending the FAI Cup Final, breaking a record that had stood for 78 years.\n\n38. Common crane\n\nCommon crane\n\nSome 300 years after they became extinct in Ireland, the common crane has made a return to these shores. Bord na M\u00f3na announced this year that a pair of common cranes returned to one of Bord na M\u00f3na\u2019s rewetted peatlands and successfully fledged a new chick. This marks the second year in a row that a chick has been fledged in Ireland, a sign that the crane population could be on the rise. Ireland has a longstanding affinity with the crane. The Gaelic name \u2018corr\u2019 forms the basis of numerous place names, while the bird plays a central role in much of our folklore. Now it looks as though the crane is ready to start its next chapter here in Ireland.\n\n39. SJP x SuperValu\n\nIn a turn of events that nobody could have anticipated, Sarah Jessica Parker revealed herself to be a SuperValu fangirl this summer. The actor, who owns a home in Co Donegal with husband Matthew Broderick, shared a series of photos on Instagram of her time in Ireland. Among them was a photo of SuperValu-branded cabbage as well as a photo of her wine on the shelves of her local store. Irish fans were tickled by the plug while SuperValu commented, \u201cSuperValu and SJP, the crossover you never knew you needed.\u201d She later jokingly described SuperValu as her \u201cfavourite place to be\u201d. First Matt Damon, now SJP. Which Hollywood star will reveal themselves to be a SuperValu fan next?\n\n40. Hollywood goes green\n\nKerry Condon\n\nThis year was the year that Irish acting talent came, saw and conquered on the awards circuit. Irish talent landed 14 nominations at this year\u2019s Academy Awards, with Colin Farrell, Paul Mescal, Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon all securing Oscar nods, meaning one-quarter of all acting nominees were Irish. Not bad going. Elsewhere, Farrell won a Golden Globe for The Banshees of Inisherin, while co-stars Keoghan and Condon both won Baftas. Meanwhile, Tipperary native Daryl McCormack was nominated for not one but two Baftas for his work in the two-hander Good Luck To You, Leo Grande. Unreal. With Cillian Murphy, Andrew Scott and Keoghan all tipped for awards success next year, it looks as though the Irish are here to stay.\n\n41. Bulldog reunited with family\n\nThe Nawrocki family with Baya\n\nThere were happy tears back in January when the Nawrocki family were reunited with their beloved dog. Baya, a French Bulldog, went missing from her home in Athenry, Co Galway, before Christmas in 2020. Two years later, she was found on a busy road in Dublin and taken in by the DSPCA. After checking Baya\u2019s microchip, they discovered she was flagged as missing or stolen and tracked down the Nawrocki family to reunite them with their four-legged friend. The emotional reunion was captured for social media and used to remind the public of the importance of microchipping your pet. The Nawrockis were overjoyed, while Baya settled back in well and bonded with the family\u2019s other dog, Diabolina.\n\n42. Afghan Sara Wahedi\u2019s trip to Tipp\n\nSara Wahedi\n\nIn October, Sara Wahedi, an award-winning entrepreneur, was on a train in Ireland when she was struck by her bottle of Tipperary Still Water. As a child, Wahedi moved to Canada from Afghanistan with her mother and brother. There, she was looked after by a Norwegian-Canadian woman named Marit and her Irish husband, Merrill. He used to sing It\u2019s a Long Way To Tipperary and encourage the children to join in. \u201cWithin a few months, you could mistake us for an Irish choir,\u201d she wrote. Wahedi recounted the full-circle moment on X, noting that the water bottle brought back memories of Merrill and his kindness. It was viewed 7.8 million times, and Wahedi was even featured on Tipp FM. The universe works in wondrous ways.\n\n43. Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\u2019s acts of kindness\n\nFans gather to remember Sinead O\u2019Connor at her funeral\n\nFollowing Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\u2019s passing, many spoke of the late singer\u2019s good deeds. Philip Woolcock wrote a letter to The Telegraph on July 29, recalling the time the singer reached out to his 20-year-old daughter Louise, who was suffering from terminal cancer. Sin\u00e9ad invited Louise to spend a week with her in London, where they dined, drank and danced. \u201cLouise returned home exhausted and happier than I had seen her since her devastating cancer diagnosis,\u201d wrote Woolcock. He added that Sin\u00e9ad, who never sought publicity for this act of kindness, stayed in touch with Louise until she passed away in 1992. \u201cToday my thoughts are with two remarkable women who, I have no doubt, will be somewhere still laughing, dancing and singing.\u201d\n\n44. JW Anderson wears Irish rugby jersey\n\nJW Anderson\n\nDesigner JW Anderson sported an unusual look to close out his Milan Fashion Week show in June. The Northern Irish designer strutted down the runway in an Ireland rugby jersey. An unusual sartorial choice for one of the world\u2019s most revered designers, perhaps, but there was a very sweet reason for it. He was paying tribute to his father, Willie Anderson, a former rugby international who earned 27 caps for Ireland. It\u2019s not the first time father and son have honoured one another. Earlier in the year, Anderson designed a custom jumpsuit for Rihanna to wear during her Super Bowl halftime show. His dad later tweeted, \u201cWe are so proud of Jonathan for designing Rihanna\u2019s outfit for the Super Bowl halftime show. Unbelievable.\u201d\n\n45. Ireland's final frontier\n\nWe have lift-off! After six years of hard work and painstaking research, Ireland launched its first ever satellite into space on December 1. Educational Irish Research Satellite, also known as Eirsat-1, blasted off into space from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. Measuring just 10.7cm x 10.7cm x 22.7cm, it was designed, built and tested by dozens of UCD students alongside experts from the European Space Agency. Within three days, the satellite had circled the Earth 34 times. The launch was hailed as a giant leap for Ireland and its nascent space sector, with UCD president Orla Feely calling it \u201ca remarkable first for the scientific community in Ireland\u201d.\n\n46. Charlie\u2019s Bar Christmas ad\n\nHeartwarming Christmas ad for Enniskillen pub goes viral\n\nForget John Lewis. The Christmas ad of the year was created by none other than Charlie\u2019s Bar in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh. The pub unveiled a charming ad depicting an elderly man walking alone through town before stepping inside the doors of Charlie\u2019s Bar and befriending a young couple. The message? \u201cThere are no strangers here, only friends you haven\u2019t met yet.\u201d The ad was filmed on a phone and cost just \u00a3700 but has attracted worldwide attention and garnered millions of views across social media. In the wake of the ad\u2019s success, the pub launched a clothing range to tackle loneliness in older people, with all proceeds raised going to Age NI and the South West Age Partnership. A heartwarming Christmas tale if ever there was one.\n\n47. Mum of 12 secures medical school place\n\nEarlier this year, Rosemary Murphy made headlines when it was revealed that the mother of 12 was returning to college to start a medical degree and become a doctor. The Dublin woman left school after her Junior Cert but harboured a lifelong ambition to study medicine. For 11 years, she devoted her time and energy to getting into medicine, completing a UCD Access course. After sitting her HPAT exams, she was shortlisted and interviewed for a place in the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland. Eventually she was offered a spot and she commenced her studies in September. Some woman for one woman.\n\n48. Solar-powered lockers in parks\n\nBoxUp\n\nAs part of efforts to encourage people to get active, a number of Local Sports Partnerships around the country have installed solar-powered BoxUp lockers in parks containing sports equipment that can be borrowed and used by the community, free of charge. Each locker contains things like tennis rackets, frisbees, basketballs and hurleys. Members of the community simply download the BoxUp app and select how long they wish to borrow each piece of equipment. The lockers have been installed in parks across Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The goal is to remove barriers to physical activity by making equipment accessible. So simple yet so clever.\n\n49. We show Seancho\u00edche some love\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Irish people love, it\u2019s telling stories. Little wonder then that Seancho\u00edche has been one of the year\u2019s breakout cultural events. Founded by Ciaran Gaffney, the storytelling event sees ordinary people get up and tell extraordinary stories around a particular theme. Indeed, the name comes from the words \u2018seancha\u00ed\u2019 and \u2018o\u00edche\u2019. The event regularly takes place in Dublin but has also popped up at venues and larger events across Ireland, including the All Together Now festival. It has also enjoyed sellout international events in London, Amsterdam and Sydney. With tickets regularly flying out the door in less than a minute, it\u2019s clear that Seancho\u00edche has tapped into our desire for human connection and developed into something special.\n\n50. Katie McCabe scores our first Women\u2019s World Cup goal\n\nInterview with Ireland Captain Katie McCabe\n\nIn July, Katie McCabe made history by scoring the Republic of Ireland\u2019s first goal at a Women\u2019s World Cup when she scored a stunner directly from a corner kick against Canada. For her efforts, the Irish captain was nominated for Goal of the Tournament. While the Republic of Ireland may have bowed out in the group stages, it was a momentous achievement that symbolised how far the women\u2019s national team have come. Elsewhere, McCabe became the first Irish Ballon d\u2019Or nominee since Roy Keane. She was one of 30 women nominated, finishing in 22nd place. G\u2019wan Katie.",

    "articleBody": "Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) \u2013 My mother was a Lutheran and the Coles were Catholics, though my grandfather fell away when he married a woman from the Brethren peace church. So it was striking to me that on this Christmas a Lutheran pastor in Bethlehem, Munther Isaac, and Pope Francis both made headlines with their sermons. The schism of the Reformation was never healed, but people in the two spiritual traditions can agree on one thing, which is that the hunger, thirst, cold, homelessness, wounds and death stalking the 2.2 million Palestinians of Gaza at the hands of the extreme right wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, aided by President Joe Biden, makes this Christmas different.\n\nPope Francis said at his evening Mass on Christmas Eve, \u201cTonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world.\u201d\n\nIn Bethlehem itself, where Pastor Isaac preaches, the city elders canceled the Christmas parade and other festivities in commemoration of the shivering Palestinians a few miles away whose stomachs are being gnawed at by hunger and whose throats are raspy with thirst. Bethlehem is a town of some 25,000 in the Palestinian West Bank occupied militarily by Israeli troops. About 11,000 of its residents are Palestinian Christians, descendants of the Near Eastern pagans and Jews living under Roman rule who embraced the message of Jesus of Nazareth in his lifetime and after.\n\nBethlehem\u2019s population is not being bombed from the sky the way the Palestinians of Gaza are, but they also suffer from Israeli occupation. According to a 2020 poll 80% of Palestinian Christians worry about being attacked by militant Israeli squatters, 83% worry that these colonizers will drive them from their homes, and 70% are concerned that the Israeli government will simply annex their land. Fully 62% of Palestinian Christians believe that the ultimate goal of the Israeli government is to expel Christians from their homeland. A good 14% have actually lost land to the Israelis, and 42% have to regularly go through Israeli security checkpoints, which have carved the West Bank up into cantons and make it difficult to get to hospital.\n\nAljazeera English: \u201c\u2018No joy in our hearts\u2019: Bethlehem\u2019s Christians face heartbreak at Christmas \u201d\n\nAlthough there are only about 800 Palestinian Christians in Gaza, they have suffered from Israeli bombardment, sniping attacks, and razing of civilian infrastructure. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem revealed in a letter last week that an Israeli army sniper \u201cmurdered two Christian women inside the Holy Family Parish in Gaza\u201d. It said that besieged mother and daughter Nahida and Samar \u201cwere shot and killed as they walked to the Sister\u2019s Convent. One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety\u201d.\n\nThey were among hundreds of Christians taking refuge in the Parish. The church had given the GPS coordinates of church properties in Gaza to the Israeli government in hopes they would be spared, but local Palestinians say that church building have been shelled by Israeli armor.\n\nPope Francis responded at that time, lamenting of the Israeli campaign against Gaza that \u201cunarmed civilians are the targets of bombings and gunfire.\u201d He condemned the assualt at the compound of the Catholic parish, \u201cwhere there are no terrorists, but families, children, people who are sick and have disabilities, and nuns . . . A mother, Mrs. Nahida Khalil Anton, and her daughter, Samar Kamal Anton, were killed, and others were wounded by the shooters while they were going to the bathroom,\u201d he announced.\n\nThe Pope continued, \u201cSome say, \u2018This is terrorism. This is war.\u2019 Yes, it is war. It is terrorism . . . That is why the Scripture affirms that \u2018God stops wars\u2026 breaks the bow, splinters the spear\u2019 (Psalm 46:10). Let us pray to the Lord for peace.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli army denied the charges and got in a snit about a \u201cblood libel.\u201d But when you are the 17th most powerful military in the world and you genocide 20,000 civilians in 11 weeks, there isn\u2019t any libel involved. It is just blood.\n\nIsraelis with a conscience, such as activist Orly Noy, the chairman of the human rights organization, B\u2019Tselem, in contrast called desperately for a ceasefire. This issue isn\u2019t about Judaism or Islam or Christianity, since there are people from each of those traditions who are on opposite sides of it.\n\nAs for Lutheran Pastor Munther Isaac, on Friday he preached a sermon, \u201cChrist in the Rubble.\u201d\n\nHe cited the enormity of the death toll, including of thousands of children, and said that as in the case of South African Apartheid the theology of the state has been wielded against the helpless. Not even that some Palestinians are Christians has evoked sympathy in European and American Christians. \u201cThis war has confirmed to us that the world does not see us as equal. Maybe it is the color of our skin. Maybe it is because we are on the wrong side of the political equation. Even our kinship in Christ did not shield us. As they said, if it takes killing 100 Palestinians to get a single \u201cHamas militant\u201d then so be it! We are not humans in their eyes. (But in God\u2019s eyes\u2026 no one can tell us we are not!).\u201d\n\nHe implicitly referred to US Evangelicals, many of whom have enthusiastically cheered on the Israeli army\u2019s genocidal (my word) actions.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for you. We will be ok. Despite the immense blow we have endured, we will recover. We will rise and stand up again from the midst of destruction, as we have always done as Palestinians, although this is by far the biggest blow we have received in a long time.\n\nBut again, for those who are complicit, I feel sorry for you. Will you ever recover from this?\u201d\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think this campaign\u2019s supporters ever will regain their souls, which they have sold for the thirty silver coins of conformism, militarism, cowardice and Islamophobia.\n\nPastor Isaac went on:\n\n\u201cIn our pain, anguish, and lament, we have searched for God, and found him under the rubble in Gaza. Jesus became the victim of the very same violence of the Empire. He was tortured. Crucified. He bled out as others watched. He was killed and cried out in pain \u2013 My God, where are you?\n\nIn Gaza today, God is under the rubble.\n\nAnd in this Christmas season, as we search for Jesus, he is to be found not on the side of Rome, but our side of the wall. In a cave, with a simple family. Vulnerable. Barely, and miraculously surviving a massacre. Among a refugee family. This is where Jesus is found.\u201d\n\nSo he inspired me to a digital painting. I\u2019ll leave you with it.",

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Recalling Jesus\u2019 birth in a stable in Bethlehem, Pope Francis in a Christmas Eve homily said that \u201cthe clash of arms even today\u201d prevents Jesus \u201cfrom finding room in the world.\u201d\n\nThe pontiff presided Sunday over the evening Mass attended by about 6,500 faithful who took their place amid the splendor of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica behind rows of white-clad prelates.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, \u201d the pope said, referring to the war sparked by Hamas\u2019 deadly Oct. 7 rampage and hostage-taking in Israel.\n\nAs Mass began, a statuette of the Christ child was unveiled before the altar bedecked in greenery and white flowers, and children representing all corners of the globe placed flowers around a gilded throne.\n\nFrancis, draped in white robes, led the Mass standing at the foot of one of St. Peter\u2019s grand columns.\n\nRecalling that Jesus was born during a census meant to reinforce King David\u2019s power, Francis warned against \u201cthe quest for worldly power and might, fame and glory, which measures everything in terms of success, results, numbers and figures, a world obsessed with achievement.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Jesus entered the world humbly, taking human flesh. \u201cHere, we see not a god of wrath and chastisement, but the God of mercy, who takes flesh and enters the world in weakness,\u201d the pope said.\n\nA pagan deity is linked to \u201cpower, worldly success and idolatry of consumerism,\u201d the pope said. \u201cGod, on the other hand, waves no magic want; he is no god of commerce who promises everything all at once. He does not save us by pushing a button, but draws near us, in order to change our world from within.\u201d\n\nWhen the Christmas Eve Mass ended, the pope, pushed in a wheelchair, moved down the basilica with the life-sized statue of Baby Jesus on his lap and flanked by children carrying bouquets. The statue was placed in a manger in a nativity scene in the basilica.\n\nFrancis, 87, has been using a wheelchair to navigate long distances due to a painful knee ligament and a cane for shorter distances.\n\nDuring the traditional Angelus blessing overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square at midday, the pontiff remembered those suffering from war, recalling specific fighting in Ukraine and Israel\u2019s bombardment and siege of the Gaza Strip in response to Hamas\u2019 attack.\n\n\u201cWe are close to our brothers and sisters suffering from war. We think of Palestine, Israel, Ukraine. We also think of those who suffer from misery, hunger, slavery,\u201d Francis said. \u201cMay the God who took a human heart for himself infuse humanity into the hearts of men,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking from the window of his studio to the thousands of faithful gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square for the Angelus prayer, the pontiff also invited the faithful \u201cnot to confuse celebration with consumerism. One can and, as a Christian, must celebrate in simplicity without waste and by sharing with those who lack necessities or lack companionship.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, Catholics mark Christmas Eve by attending Mass at midnight. But over the years, the starting time at the Vatican has crept earlier, reflecting the health or stamina of popes and then the pandemic. The Vatican has kept a 7:30 p.m. time originally set during a pandemic curfew.\n\nOn Christmas Day, tens of thousands of Romans, tourists and pilgrims were expected to crowd into St. Peter\u2019s Square to hear Pope Francis deliver an address on world issues and give his blessing. The speech, known in Latin as \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d (to the city and to the world), is traditionally an occasion to review crises including war, persecution and hunger, in many parts of the globe.",

Hamas\u2019s death toll figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed over 8,000 operatives from the group and allied terror organizations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,\u201d Pope Francis said as he kicked off an evening mass at Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican.\n\nDuring the traditional Angelus blessing overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square at midday, the pontiff remembered those suffering from war, recalling specific fighting in Ukraine and Israel\u2019s bombardment and siege of the Gaza Strip in response to Hamas\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cWe are close to our brothers and sisters suffering from war.

And this dulls and threatens to suffocate the joy of Christmas.\u201d\n\nBelievers in Syria gathered in a country still suffering from the aftermath of a long civil war and suffocating economic blockade. Despite festive lights and Christmas decorations adorning houses and shopfronts in the capital Damascus, events in Gaza and ongoing battles in parts of the country have left the holiday atmosphere subdued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Yabroud, a city north of Damascus, worshippers gathered in the St. Constantine and Helen Cathedral to enjoy Christmas carols sung by the Joy Choir from Damascus.\n\n\u201cEveryone should try, with what the Lord has given them, to spread joy in order to help end this sorrow,\u201d said Fadi Homsi, a member of the choir.\n\nFestivities are usually held in Bethlehem, where faithful believe Jesus was born, but this year the city is almost deserted, with few worshippers around and no Christmas tree erected, after church leaders decided to forego \u201cany unnecessarily festive\u201d celebrations in solidarity with Gazans.\n\nThe town did away with its giant Christmas tree, marching bands and flamboyant nativity scene this year, settling for just a few festive lights.\n\nIn the center of town, a huge Palestinian flag had been unfolded with a banner declaring that \u201cThe bells of Bethlehem ring for a ceasefire in Gaza.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll Christmas celebrations have been canceled,\u201d said Sister Nabila Salah from the Catholic Holy Church in Gaza. \u201cHow do we celebrate when we are\u2026 hearing the sound of tanks and bombardment instead of the ringing of bells?\u201d\n\nThe Jordanian army said its air force had air-dropped aid to about 800 people sheltering at the Church of Saint Porphyrius in northern Gaza.\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0644\u062d\u0629 \u062a\u0646\u0641\u0630 \u0625\u0646\u0632\u0627\u0644\u0627\u064b \u062c\u0648\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0634\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0633 \u0628\u0631\u0641\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0633 \u0628\u063a\u0632\u0629 pic.twitter.com/d1ldiRjI4i Advertisement \u2014 Jordan TV-\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0632\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u062f\u0646\u064a (@JrtvMedia) December 24, 2023\n\nAt a hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where much of the fighting has been concentrated recently, Fadi Sayegh, whose family has previously received permits to travel to Bethlehem for celebrations, said he would not be celebrating Christmas this year.\n\n\u201cThere is no joy. No Christmas tree, no decorations, no family dinner, no celebrations,\u201d he said, while undergoing dialysis. \u201cI pray for this war to be over soon.\u201d\n\nEurope steps up security\n\nThe fighting in Gaza also overshadowed celebrations in Europe, where reported fears of an Islamist attack forced worshippers and others to undergo extra security precautions.\n\nSightseeing-only visits were barred at Germany\u2019s landmark cathedral in Cologne and Christmas Eve worshippers faced security checks to get into midnight Mass there Sunday as police responded to indications of a potential attack. Still, officials urged people not to shy away from holiday celebrations out of fear.\n\nAuxiliary Bishop Rolf Steinhaeuser greeted people attending services with a relaxed smile and an expression of thanks for police security efforts, a day after police descended on the cathedral and searched it with sniffer dogs. With several dozen officers on duty outside, he said it was \u201cprobably the most secure church service in all of Germany.\u201d\n\nIn Austria, police said they also were stepping up security around Vienna\u2019s churches and Christmas markets, apparently responding to the same intelligence about a potential threat. They did not give further information, but the dpa news agency reported without citing a source that the threat was from an Islamic extremist group.\n\nCologne\u2019s towering cathedral, whose twin spires rise 157 meters (515 feet) high, is a major tourist destination visited by some 6 million people a year. It is home to the Shrine of the Three Kings, a gold- and silver-decorated casket said to contain the relics of the wise men described in the New Testament as paying homage to the newborn Jesus.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, warned December 5 that Europe faces a \u201chuge risk of terrorist attacks\u201d over the Christmas holidays due to fallout from the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Johansson provided no details about any police or security information that might have led to her warning.",

Palestinians continue to suffer for western empire's spoils, under the guise of safeguarding the Jewish people.\n\nAfter Palestinians, Zionism's next victim is the Jewish faith.\n\nIsrael and Zionists around the world weaponise Jewish symbols to intimidate, humiliate and lay claim to that which they deem theirs. Israeli soldiers have branded the face of a Palestinian prisoner with the Star of David. Israeli forces notoriously make blindfolded kidnapped Palestinians wave or wear the Israeli flag - emblazoned with a blue Star of David - videotaping the humiliation to disseminate online for Zionists to join in the jeering.\n\nIsraelis taunt Palestinians with cheers for a \"Happy Hanukkah\" while launching air strikes on communities dying of starvation and disease. How is this honouring the Jewish faith?\n\nHow will Jewish people being inextricably tied to mass murder \"protect Jewish people\" globally?\n\nStay informed with MEE's newsletters Sign up to get the latest alerts, insights and analysis, starting with Turkey Unpacked\n\n'Symbol of violence'\n\nAs Jews around the world prepared for the start of Hanukkah this year, Israel murdered a beloved powerhouse intellectual, a Palestinian professor who represented the soaring voice of Gaza. The poet and educator Dr Refaat Alareer - and six members of his family - were \"surgically targeted\" and assassinated by Israel in his sister's home in Gaza City.\n\nZionist soldiers marked the first night of Hanukkah by erecting a gigantic menorah in the rubble of decimated homes, where bodies remain trapped\n\nAs I and many other Jews made arrangements for our annual festival of lights, Israel brutally assassinated Refaat as part of an ongoing campaign to snuff out the storytellers and journalists of Gaza. They claim to do this in our names.\n\nNear the site where Israel assassinated Refaat, Zionist soldiers marked the first night of Hanukkah by erecting a gigantic menorah in the rubble of decimated homes, where the unrecovered bodies of loved ones remain trapped.\n\nInstead of the menorah representing the hope and spirit of our people at this moment, it proclaims to the world a colonial military victory - a symbol of violent conquest in a place where a poet's passionate dissent was exterminated by Israel's death machine.\n\nFollow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine war\n\nIn the legendary story we celebrate every Hanukkah, a tiny amount of oil miraculously provided the Maccabees eight nights of fuel to keep their temple lit. It has become a celebration of their faith and perseverance as Jewish freedom fighters facing down violent tyranny. Refaat and so many others martyred by Israel echo the resistance of these Jewish rebels - immortal symbols of light in the face of state terror and a reminder that the Palestinian spirit can never be extinguished.\n\nZionism was once a fringe nationalist political movement within Judaism: only when its interests aligned with western imperialism did it receive the necessary backing to colonise Palestine. But so long as Zionist nationalism has existed, so have anti-Zionist Jews, rejecting the notion that our people should murder and displace Palestinians to build a western-backed settler-colony.\n\nThis genocide is a ceaseless nightmare with frightening echoes of the Holocaust. Zionist weaponisation of the Star of David is reminiscent of jeering Nazis who wielded the (stolen and appropriated) swastika symbol to humiliate Jews before mowing them down in the streets.\n\nI am continually struck by the glee with which Zionists abuse Palestinians and make a mockery of our sacred symbols and prayers. The Israeli occupation forces recently raided a mosque, detaining and abusing Palestinians while hijacking the mosque's speaker system to sing Hebrew prayers.\n\nThis is an affront to the Muslim Palestinians praying in their sacred place of worship and an insult to every single Jewish person of conscience who rejects the weaponisation of our faith by Israeli fascists.\n\n'Politicising Judaism'\n\nZionists drag Judaism through the mud by graffitiing and searing the Star of David to assert dominance over Palestinians while holding a literal knife to the neck of our Torah scrolls. But the symbolic death of the soul of Judaism pales in comparison to the material, ongoing devastation of the Palestinian genocide.\n\nZionism is no longer a fringe ideology within Judaism: we grapple with genocide and occupation that the majority of our community supports\n\nIsrael has murdered more than 20,000 Palestinians and counting. It has displaced almost two million people more and intentionally destroyed homes, the ecosystem and infrastructure to render Gaza uninhabitable for those who manage to survive starvation, dehydration and carpet bombing.\n\nSo long as Israel massacres Palestine using the Jewish faith as a weapon of war, people will falsely conflate the global Jewish community with Israel.\n\nIn politicising Judaism, Zionists have robbed Jews of a faith practice divorced from nationalist barbarism.\n\nAntisemitic western countries are completely satisfied to have Jewish people act as moral cover and human shields for their imperialism. These are the same countries like the US that rejected entry for Jewish Holocaust refugees but without hesitation poured billions into Israel's military expansion project.\n\nZionism is no longer a fringe ideology within Judaism: we grapple with genocide and occupation that the majority of our community supports. This is a result of ongoing Zionist indoctrination that dehumanises and erases Palestinian life, teaches entitlement to Palestinian land, centres fear and Islamophobia, and sanitises Israel's brutality.\n\nNothing helps the \u201cfight against antisemitism\u201d more than using the Star of David by the Israeli army spoxperson in propaganda clip as cross hairs for Palestinian homes before flattened on top of families and tearing children into pieces pic.twitter.com/b9Cb4PRSKQ \u2014 Tameem | \u062a\u0645\u064a\u0645 (@TameeOliveFern) December 19, 2023\n\nPart of stepping into Jewish anti-Zionism is accepting the fact that our religion has been hijacked by fascists who commit ongoing genocide on behalf of colonial powers.\n\nIf Jewish people don't want to be incorrectly associated with Israel's tyranny, the answer is to be vocally anti-Zionist and work to dismantle both Zionism and Israel's settler-colony. As an anti-Zionist Jew, I eagerly embrace integrating Palestinian liberation into my faith practice.\n\nDecoupling Zionism from my Judaic rituals isn't a burden: it fills my Judaism with the divine energy of Tikkun Olam - the Jewish moral imperative to repair the world.\n\nDisentangling Zionism from Judaism deepens my connection with my Jewish ancestors who, like Palestinians, fought with every dying breath to resist annihilation. Judaism will outlive violent Zionist nationalism and when Palestine frees itself, it will free us all.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.",

After that, Khawaja decided to wear the black armband, for which ICC reprimanded him.\n\nSpeaking to The Weekend Australian, Holding said, \u201cThe ICC regulations say re messaging \u2018approval shall not be granted for messages, which relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes'.\"\n\n\u201cSo, how the f*** people were allowed to take a knee for BLM (Black Lives Matter), and stumps were covered with LGBTQ colours?\u201d Holding added.\n\nFurther slamming the cricket's governing body for not taking a clear stance on this issue, Holding said, \u201cIf it had been most other organisations that showed some semblance of consistency with their attitude and behaviour on issues, I could claim surprise, but not them. Once again, they show their hypocrisy and lack of moral standing as an organisation.\"\n\nKhawaja continues to take stance\n\nDespite being shrugged off a few times over the same issue, Khawaja continues to stand for what he believes in.\n\nOn Sunday, two days before the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, Khawaja was spotted donning a black dove logo and holding an olive branch on his bat and shoes during the training session.\n\nPer The Sydney Morning Herald, the Aussie batter was also spotted using a sticker on his bat, with a reference to one of the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: \u201cAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\u201d",

The navy also struck positions where Hamas squads had launched mortars and fired upon Israeli soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Air Force killed a Hamas commander in an air strike in the area of Khan Yunis. A separate air strike killed several terrorists carrying a rocket, the IDF added.\n\nIn northern Gaza, soldiers directed an airstrike on a building where Hamas operatives were hiding.\n\nAt least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas\u2019s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on Oct. 7. The number of men, women, children, soldiers and foreigners held captive in Gaza by Hamas is now believed to be 129.\n\nOther people remain unaccounted for as Israeli authorities continue to identify bodies and search for human remains.",

    "articleBody": "The Israeli army has raided and detained staff at two of the last functioning hospitals in Gaza's north, where the defense minister said on Tuesday that troops were working to completely clear out Hamas militants.\n\nIsrael bombarded towns across southern Gaza on Tuesday with airstrikes, killing at least 45 Palestinians and pressing ahead with its offensive with renewed backing from the United States, despite rising international alarm.\n\nThe Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, warned the campaign in Gaza's south will persist for months.\n\nIn a hospital in the southern town of Rafah, Mahmoud Zoarab bid farewell to his two children a 2-year-old boy, and a girl born two weeks ago killed in a predawn strike on their home.\n\nWounded in the strike, he winced as he peeled back the shrouds to look at their faces as his wife and mother stood by his bed.\n\nJust two weeks old. Her name hadn't even been registered, said the children's grandmother, Suzan Zoarab. Addressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, she cried, Does he think that by killing these children he will achieve something? Have they succeeded now? Has he achieved what he wants?\n\n\n\nDefence Minister Gallant said Israeli forces were entering Hamas' tunnel network in northern Gaza as part of a final clearing of militants from the region. The densely built urban north, including Gaza City, has seen ferocious fighting between troops and militants, with Palestinian health officials reporting dozens of people killed in bombardment in recent days.\n\nIsraeli troops have raided a series of hospitals and shelters in the north, detaining men in a search for militants and expelling others taking refuge there.\n\nGallant said that in southern Gaza, operations will take months, including the military's assault on Khan Younis, the territory's second largest city. We will not stop until we reach our goals, he said.\n\nAfter meeting with Israeli officials on Monday, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin urged Israel to protect civilians but reiterated America's support for Israel in its war against Hamas, saying he was not here to dictate timelines or terms\".\n\nAustin's remarks signalled that the US would continue shielding Israel from growing international calls for a cease-fire as the UN Security Council again delayed a vote and would keep providing aid for one of the 21st century's deadliest military campaigns.\n\nSTRIKES ACROSS GAZA\n\n\n\nSuzan Zoarab said her family was asleep when their home was hit before dawn.\n\nWe found the whole house had collapsed over us. Twenty-seven people were killed in the strike, along with at least three others in a separate strike in Rafah, according to Associated Press journalists who saw the bodies arrive at two local hospitals early Tuesday.\n\nRafah, which is in the southern part of Gaza and where Israel has told Palestinians to seek shelter, has been repeatedly bombarded, often killing large numbers of civilians. Israel said Tuesday it had killed a prominent Hamas financier in an airstrike on Rafah, without specifying when it occurred.\n\nIn central Gaza, at least 15 people were killed in strikes overnight, according to hospital records. Among the dead were a mother and her four children, who were killed as they sat around a fire, according to an AP reporter who filmed the aftermath.\n\nFierce battles also raged in northern Gaza, which has been reduced to a wasteland seven weeks after Israeli tanks and troops stormed in. The military said Tuesday its forces took operational control of the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya. Israel has killed hundreds of Hamas militants there and detained another 500 suspected militants, according to a statement from division commander Brig. Gen. Itsik Cohen.\n\nThe claims could not be independently confirmed.\n\nFootage online showed a scene of devastation after a strike that hit a local charity in Jabaliya, with several torn bodies near a donkey cart on a street filled with rubble and twisted metal. At least 27 people were killed in that strike and others in the district Tuesday, according to Munir al-Bursh, a senior Health Ministry official.\n\nThe Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Tuesday the death toll since the start of the war had risen to more than 19,600. It does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.\n\nHamas has continued to put up stiff resistance and lob rockets at Israel. The militants said they fired a barrage toward Tel Aviv on Tuesday, and air raid sirens went off in central Israel. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.\n\nThe war began after Hamas and other militants killed some 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and abducted 240 others.\n\nIsrael's military says 131 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive. Israel says it has killed some 7,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames civilian deaths on Hamas, saying it uses them as human shields when it fights in residential areas.\n\nHOSPITAL RAID\n\n\n\nIsraeli forces raided the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City overnight, according to the church that operates it, destroying a wall at its front entrance and detaining most of its staff.\n\nThe facility was the scene of an explosion early in the war that killed dozens of Palestinians, and which an Associated Press investigation later determined was likely caused by a misfired Palestinian rocket.\n\nDon Binder, a pastor at St. George's Anglican Cathedral, which runs the hospital, said the raid left just two doctors, four nurses and two janitors to tend to over 100 seriously wounded patients, with no running water or electricity.\n\nBinder said an Israeli tank was parked on the rubble at the hospital's entrance, blocking anyone from entering or leaving.\n\nIsraeli troops seized northern Gaza's Al Awda hospital on Sunday after besieging it for 12 days, the international aid group Doctors Without Borders said on Tuesday.\n\nThe troops stripped, bound and interrogated all males over 16, including six of the group's staff, it said. Most were sent back into the hospital, which the troops still hold, with dozens of patients inside but no essential supplies, it said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military about the hospital raids.\n\nForces have raided other hospitals across northern Gaza, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff have denied the allegations and accused Israel of endangering critically ill and wounded civilians.\n\nSECURITY COUNCIL AGAIN POSTPONES VOTE ON NEW TRUCE PROPOSAL\n\n\n\nUN Security Council members continued intense negotiations on an Arab-sponsored resolution to spur desperately needed humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza during some kind of a halt in the fighting.\n\nA vote on the resolution, first postponed from Monday, was pushed back again until Wednesday as talks continued to get the US to abstain or vote yes on the resolution after it vetoed an earlier cease-fire call.\n\nFrance, the United Kingdom and Germany some of Israel's closest allies joined global calls for a cease-fire over the weekend. In Israel, protesters have called for negotiations with Hamas to facilitate the release of scores of hostages still held by the group.\n\nCIA Director William Burns met in Warsaw with the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency and the prime minister of Qatar on Monday, the first known meeting of the three since the cease-fire and the release of some 100 hostages in a deal they helped broker.\n\nBut US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the talks were not at a point where another deal is imminent.\n\nHamas and other militants are still holding an estimated 129 captives.\n\nNetanyahu has insisted that Israel will keep fighting until it ends Hamas rule in Gaza, crushes its military capabilities and frees all the hostages taken during the October 7 attack.",

In the process, 750,000 Palestinians were expelled, their villages destroyed or dwellings expropriated. Many of these exiles ended up in refugee camps in Gaza.\n\nFor the last 75 years Palestinians have been calling for the same right to exist in a secure homeland as is accorded Israel. In the latest war, Israel\u2019s killing 17,000 people and destroying Gaza in the name of self-defense will not make Israel safer nor squelch the desire of Palestinian for a homeland.\n\nIt may seem paradoxical, but if the $3.8 billion given yearly to Israel were diverted to Palestinians to rebuild Gaza, accompanied by vigorous pursuit of a secure state for Palestinians, it would undercut the hostility on which Hamas feeds and make Israel safer as well.\n\nJ.
