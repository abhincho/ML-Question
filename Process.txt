Timeline Summarization of Israel-Hamas War
Objective: The goal is to generate a timeline summarization of the major events in the Israel-Hamas war using news articles collected over a period.

Steps:

Downloading Dataset:

The dataset containing news articles is downloaded from a Google Drive link using the gdown package.
We specify the file ID and destination path for the downloaded JSON file.


Load and Parse JSON Data:

The JSON file is loaded into memory, articles are extracted for processing to make the summarization process more manageable.


Filter Relevant Articles:

Articles related to the Israel-Hamas war are filtered using a keyword search. Articles containing the keyword in their body or title are considered relevant.


Summarization Using BART:

The BART model from the transformers library is used to summarize the text of each article.
The BART model is initialized with the facebook/bart-large-cnn pre-trained weights.


Generate Timeline:

Articles are grouped by their modification dates to form a timeline of events.
Summaries for articles within the same date are concatenated and summarized as a single block to represent the event for that date.


Print Timeline:

The summarized events are printed in a timeline format, showing the start and end dates along with a summary description.


Code Execution:

The script is executed from the main function. It downloads the data, filters relevant articles, summarizes them, generates a timeline, and prints the results.
