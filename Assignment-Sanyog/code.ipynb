              "'Heavy clashes  more deadly aid chaos in war ravaged Gaza The Palestine Red Crescent said five people were killed and dozens injured by gunfire and a stampede during an aid delivery in Gaza s north The Israeli military told AFP it  has no record of the incident described  GAZA STRIP  Palestinian Territories  Heavy clashes and explosions shook Gaza  witnesses said on Saturday  as the Red Crescent reported several people killed during the latest chaotic aid distribution in the territory s north  where famine looms  Israel s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved a new round of talks on a Gaza truce between Israel and Hamas militants  after a binding UN Security Council resolution last Monday demanded an  immediate ceasefire   A subsequent ruling by the world s top court ordered Israel to ensure aid reaches civilians  whose desperation was again laid bare Saturday  The Palestine Red Crescent said five people were killed and dozens injured by gunfire and a stampede during an aid delivery in Gaza s north  Eyewitnesses told AFP that Gazans overseeing the aid delivery shot in the air  but Israeli troops in the area also opened fire and some moving trucks hit people trying to get the food  The Israeli military told AFP it  has no record of the incident described   Fighting has not eased   including around the territory s largest hospital   and the latest toll from the health ministry in the Hamas run Gaza Strip said at least 82 more people were killed in the previous 24 hours  The Hamas press office reported more than 50 Israeli air strikes over the past day  with  civilian houses  targeted across the coastal territory  as well as tank fire in the Gaza City area and southern Gaza  Israel s military on Saturday said it had struck dozens of targets  including militants and their compounds in central and northern Gaza  The war began with Hamas s October 7 attack that resulted in about 1 160 deaths in Israel  mostly civilians  according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures  Israel s retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 32 705 people  mostly women and children  according to the health ministry  Netanyahu s office said new talks on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release will take place in Doha and Cairo  in the coming days    with guidelines for moving forward in the negotiations   Talks had appeared deadlocked despite a push by the United States   which provides billions of dollars in military aid to Israel   and fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar to secure a truce for the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan  now more than halfway through  In its ruling  the International Court of Justice  ICJ  in The Hague said it had accepted South Africa s argument that the further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza required Israel to do more  with famine now  setting in   Saturday s aid delivery chaos is the latest incident of its kind in north Gaza  where a UN backed report has projected famine by May unless urgent intervention occurs  The report released on March 19 warned that half of Gazans are feeling  catastrophic  hunger  The Israeli defense ministry body responsible for Palestinian civil affairs  COGAT  said the assessment contained inaccuracies and questionable sources  Israel s allies  and the UN  have blamed Israel for limitations on the aid flow but COGAT accused United Nations agencies of being unable to handle the quantity of assistance arriving daily  With limited ground access  several nations have begun aid airdrops  and a ship was expected to depart Saturday from Cyprus with the second cargo of food assistance  ICJ rulings are binding but it has little means of enforcement  On Saturday Israel s military said it was continuing operations around Gaza s largest hospital Al Shifa for a 13th day  Most of the Palestinian territory s hospitals are not functioning and its health system is  barely surviving   the United Nations humanitarian agency  OCHA  said  Israel s military accuses Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant group of hiding inside medical facilities  using patients  staff and displaced people for cover   charges the militants have denied  Troops first raided Al Shifa in November  but the army says Palestinian fighters have since returned  The army said it  continued to eliminate  militants and locate weapons in the area  adding to a toll of around 200 it earlier reported killed in the Al Shifa operation  On Saturday Hamas said that in addition to the ongoing Al Shifa operation  Israeli troops continued  aggression  against Nasser Hospital and  besiege  Al Amal Hospital in the same city  The army said troops continue to operate in the Al Amal area of Khan Yunis  Gaza s Christian minority are marking Easter weekend  but in Jerusalem fewer pilgrims were visible   There is a deep sadness you can feel in the air   John Timmons  of Australia  said on Good Friday  when Christians in the walled Old City follow the path they believe Christ took to his crucifixion  Fears of a wider regional conflagration intensified on Friday as Israel struck targets of Lebanon s Hamas allied Hezbollah movement in Syria and Lebanon  Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran  Israel s arch enemy  The Israeli military said it killed the deputy commander of Hezbollah s rocket unit in south Lebanon in an air strike  In a new toll issued Saturday  a war monitor said the Israeli strikes in Syria on Friday killed seven Hezbollah members  seven Syrian pro Iran fighters and 38 Syrian soldiers  the highest Syrian army toll in Israeli strikes since the Gaza war began   We have turned from the ones who are repelling Hezbollah to the ones who are chasing them  We reach all the places that Hezbollah is present   Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on a visit to Northern Command  vowing to  speed up the pace   The United Nations said four of its military observers were wounded Saturday when a shell exploded near them in southern Lebanon  In their October attack  Palestinian militants also seized about 250 hostages  Israel believes about 130 remain in Gaza  including 34 who are presumed dead  Netanyahu is under domestic pressure  facing regular demonstrations  over his failure to bring home all of the captives \\nThe media firestorm over whether Israel attacked the al Ahli hospital in Gaza is over  It was an errant rocket shot by the Iran backed Islamic Jihad group that exploded near the compound  But another media firestorm is brewing  and it will focus squarely on the Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City  Al Shifa is the largest hospital in Gaza  It is also  according to numerous and credible reports  a Hamas base of military operations  The specifics have been revealed in a steady drip of open source information dating back to 2006  when a PBS documentary showed Hamas fighters roaming Shifa s halls  intimidating staff  and denying access to parts of the hospital  The following year  according to Human Rights Watch  Hamas fired at its rival group Fatah from within the Shifa hospital compound during a Palestinian civil war  As one doctor said   the medical staff are suffering from fear and terror  particularly of the Hamas fighters  who are in every corner of the hospital   In 2008  the year that marked the first rocket war between Hamas and Israel  the New York Times noted that Hamas was operating openly within the hospital  and that members of the group murdered a patient there  One Times report stated that the Hamas leadership was located in a bunker under the hospital s burn ward  while the group fired rockets from areas near the hospital  in an effort to deter an Israeli response  The following year  the Times cited Yuval Diskin  the former head of Israel s internal security services  Shin Bet   who said Hamas leadership was holed up in a bunker below building number 2 of Shifa Hospital  Avi Dichter  another former head of the Shin Bet  stated in 2009 that Hamas s operations in Shifa was an open secret  It was such an open secret that Hamas operative Rami Misbah Abed Rabbo admitted himself that Hamas took over a large bunker under Shifa during the war with Israel in 2008  During the 2014 war between Hamas and Israel  multiple credible media outlets reported on the Hamas operations in the Gaza hospital  The Washington Post reported that Shifa was a  de facto headquarters  for Hamas  Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Casey tweeted an image of a Hamas spokesman giving an interview at a Gaza hospital  saying   You have to wonder   how patients at Shifa hospital feel as Hamas uses it as a safe place to see media   The tweet was later deleted  Similarly  Palestinian journalist Radjaa Abou Dagga wrote about how Hamas used Shifa for military purposes  but then sought to remove the article  fearing for his family s safety  An open source intelligence report also published in Israel that year cited Palestinian sources who noted that Hamas used Shifa s x ray department as a jail and interrogation facility  An Amnesty International report the following year cited evidence of Hamas torturing and killing prisoners in Shifa  In the course of my own research on Hamas over the last 10 years  multiple Israeli officials across multiple government agencies have confirmed the existence of a Hamas command center below the Shifa hospital  The group is believed to have constructed significant infrastructure well beneath the ground  This includes an operations room that effectively serves as the eyes and ears of Hamas across the Gaza Strip  with direct and secure lines to the Iranian regime  Hezbollah  other state patrons  and nonstate partners  Since the Hamas attack of October 7  Israel has warned that it plans to destroy all Hamas infrastructure in the Gaza Strip  In private conversations with former Israeli officials  I have heard Shifa mentioned multiple times  Nobody has stated that Israel is preparing to destroy the command center  But the implication is not hard to miss  A ground invasion might lead to Israeli forces working to clear the compound  floor by floor  room by room  However  such a battle would put Israeli forces at a disadvantage  If given a choice  Israel would almost certainly elect to destroy the command center by air  This would  of course  mean additional misery for the beleaguered people of Gaza  There is a legal term for what Hamas is doing  It is using the medical staff and patients as  human shields  to protect Hamas terrorists from lawful attack  Doing so is a war crime  prohibited by the international law of armed conflict  The United Nations and governments worldwide have condemned the use of human shields  However  none of these actors have come forth yet to condemn Hamas for using al Shifa as a military headquarters  The coming battle over Shifa promises to be intense  The Israeli  American  and other governments should reveal what is known about the Hamas presence there right now  Hamas must be pressured to vacate if tragedy is to be averted  Of course  this is easier said than done  Hamas is defiant as Israel prepares for a ground invasion now  Still  the coming standoff need not lead to the destruction of the Shifa hospital  Rather  Israel should continue to clear the northern Gaza Strip and even bombard the entire area surrounding Shifa once civilians have been evacuated  When it is safe for Israeli forces to enter  they should surround the hospital and demand that unconditional surrender of the Hamas leadership still holed up inside  This is a drama that should play out in front of the entire world  Should Hamas refuse to surrender after a period of days or even weeks  Israel should carefully enter the compound  The first goal must be to defend the lives of all patients and doctors inside  But  when all is said and done  Israel must emerge from this compound with photos  videos  captured weapons  and other evidence of Hamas military activities that took place under the hospital  Many critics of Israel have questioned whether a ground invasion could end Hamas  It s a fair question  There may not be a military solution on its own  But military operations supplemented with damning evidence that Hamas has held the Gaza Strip hostage could prove to be a dramatic moment that swings world opinion against the Iran backed terrorist organization  once and for all \\nHasan Bitmez  a member of the conservative Felicity Party  delivered a passionate address at the General Assembly of the Turkish parliament

Spokesman Rear Adm  Daniel Hagari says the Hamas terror group s main base of operations is under Shifa Hospital in Gaza City  Hagari says that Hamas has several underground complexes under Shifa   the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip   which are used by the terror group s leaders to direct attacks against Israel  He notes   We have concrete evidence that hundreds of terrorists flooded into the hospital to hide there after the massacres of October 7   He says Israel has intelligence that there are several tunnels leading to the underground base from outside the hospital  so that Hamas officials do not need to enter the hospital to reach it  But Hagari adds that there is also an entrance to the underground complex from within one of the wards   Hamas terrorists operate inside and under Shifa hospital   and other hospitals in Gaza   with a network of terror tunnels   he says   Shifa is not the only hospital   it is one of many  Hamas use of hospitals is systematic   Additionally  according to the IDF  Hamas s internal security has a command center inside Shifa Hospital  from which it directs rocket fire on Israel and stores weapons  IDF says Hamas uses Shifa Hospital in Gaza as underground base  IDF claims there are several underground complexes used by Hamas to direct their activities and a tunnel that reaches the hospital  and allows entrance to the Hamas headquarters without going through the hospital  pic twitter com 4MakZfG3Ud   Clash Report   clashreport  October 27  2023 Hagari accuses Hamas of using the hospital   with 1 500 beds and some 4 000 staff   as human shields   Hamas uses Shifa hospital as a shield for Hamas terror infrastructure   Hagari says   Hamas wages war from hospitals  By operating from these hospitals  Hamas not only endangers the lives of Israeli civilians  but also exploits innocent Gazan civilians   Hamas terrorists operate inside hospitals precisely because they know that the IDF distinguishes between terrorists and civilians   He says that the hospital s energy infrastructure is also used by Hamas s underground base  He says the information on Hamas s use of the hospital is based on a wide range of intelligence sources collected by the Military Intelligence Directorate and Shin Bet security agency  He says the intel has already been provided to allies  And he warns   When medical facilities are used for terror purposes  they are liable to lose their protection from attack in accordance with international law  \\nThe New Yorker has been speaking with doctors at a hospital in southern Gaza  Nasser Medical Center  where conditions have been rapidly deteriorating during the Israeli bombing campaign  Scroll down to read the report  and turn on audio to hear excerpts of the interviews  Dr  Omar al Najjar   This war began at its peak  Began at peak destruction  The New Yorker   Have you lost hope in living in Gaza  Dr  Omar al Najjar   Gaza is the place we were born and raised  However much they try to frighten and scare us  I agree with my family that I can t ever leave Gaza  News Desk Another Hospital in Gaza Is Bleeding Doctors in southern Gaza are overwhelmed by the dead and the wounded and by displaced Palestinians sleeping on the floor  The baby arrived at Nasser Medical Center  in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis  just before noon on the tenth day of Israel s bombing campaign  An air strike had hit the home of a local family  who had been hosting a family of displaced people from Gaza City  to the north  Dozens were injured or killed  Doctors in the emergency room scrambled to assess the newcomers and discovered the still body of an infant boy  He was covered in a thick layer of debris  As a medic began compressions on the baby s chest  Mohammed Zaqout  a senior pediatrician and the former director of the hospital  came over to examine the infant and detected a breath   Praise God  the baby didn t have any injuries    Ayman al Farra  a Gaza health official who has worked in the hospital s emergency room since the start of the conflict  told us  in a telephone interview  But who were the boy s parents  and what was his name  The baby was hardly the first unidentified patient the doctors had treated since Israel began bombing Gaza  Omar al Najjar  a twenty four year old intern stationed in the emergency room  explained in a phone interview that when an air strike hits a home  it often injures or kills everyone in a family  leaving no one available to identify the dead and wounded   So we write  Unknown 1    Unknown 2    Unknown 3     he said  An unidentified but otherwise healthy baby was an unusual circumstance but Najjar scarcely had time to notice   We don t feel the beginning or the end of the day  because we are continuously in

into Nasser Medical Center in Khan Younis  in southern Gaza  on October 16th  Photograph by Yousef Masoud   NYT   Redux Najjar lives east of Khan Younis  in a town that is half a mile from the fortified barrier that marks the border with Israel   His grandparents had lived in a village near the coastal city of Jaffa  in what is now Israel  and had fled to Gaza as refugees   On the morning of October 7th  Najjar had been asleep at home when Hamas fighters broke through the barrier and slaughtered fourteen hundred Israelis in surrounding towns  The next day  the Israel Defense Forces instructed the residents of Najjar s town  via text  to evacuate immediately  Najjar s family fled to Khan Younis  his parents squeezed into the home of a relative  in the center of town  while his pregnant sister and her family moved into a United Nations school for refugees  Najjar himself began living full time at the hospital where he worked  sleeping on the floor of the office of internal medicine  Administrators placed the hospital s staff about a thousand people on alternating twenty four hour shifts  Najjar usually helps out during his days off  too  In any case  he noted   I don t have a place to return to   On the eighth day of air strikes  he learned that Israeli bombs had destroyed his home and flattened the area around it  Top  a map of Israel and Palestine  showing

overcrowded hallways and offices   There s not a nurses  room or doctor s office that doesn t have twenty staff members in it   he said  As hundreds of thousands of Gazans have fled the bombs and an expected ground invasion from Israel  thousands of healthy people have also moved into the hospital complex  To the doctors  frustration  the displaced have bedded down in courtyards  in corridors  and even atop roofs   They put their bags down  and that becomes their place   Najjar told us   There s not one place that s empty   Clogged hallways and elevators are slowing down medical staff and inhibiting the transport of patients  and the swelling population is straining the hospital s limited supply of well water  But what can the hospital do  Waleed Abu Hatab  the director of maternal medicine  told us   We can t stop them from using the bathrooms or water there s no way we can do that   So far  the hospital has remained an island of safety  Repeated air strikes have destroyed much of the surrounding neighborhood  In photographs  the pale red brick tower of the Nasser Medical Center now stands like a lighthouse overlooking a sea of rubble   A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told us that they do not target hospitals   But  as the siege continues  conditions inside are deteriorating  During a phone call with us  Farra called out to a colleague   Ibrahim  did bread come today   The answer was no  Farra and other doctors told us that since the war began the hospital has been feeding its patients and staff only rice for lunch and dinner  sometimes adding cheese and cucumbers at the evening meal   The Health Ministry can t bring fruit now  because it s in very short supply   Farra said   I was at a vegetable market earlier  and the prices are very high  We can t provide them   Omar al Najjar  a twenty four year old medical intern  has been living at the Nasser Medical Center since the bombardment started  Many people have taken refuge at the hospital and are also sheltering there full time  Omar al Najjar  a twenty four year old medical intern  has been living at the Nasser Medical Center since the bombardment started  Many people have taken refuge at the hospital and are also sheltering there full time  The hospital  which is designed to accommodate three hundred and fifty inpatients  is dangerously overfull  administrators have tripled the number of beds in the emergency room to sixty  doubled the number of operating rooms to twelve  and expanded the intensive care unit from twelve beds to forty  Yet  even in the intensive care unit  some of the wounded must be laid on the ground or in the hall  because there are not enough beds  Najjar  the intern  told us that the victims of bombings always arrive in large numbers at least ten at a time  Farra told us   All the injuries are serious they require surgeries and intensive care   He continued   The medicine has been depleted  The anesthesia has been depleted   There are shortages of chest tubes  dialysis filters  saline solution  and orthopedic equipment  Najjar told us that he was forced to tell a patient with a face wound to go out to a local drug store to buy the supplies needed to stitch up the gash  The hospital s biggest crisis  however  is its dwindling supply of fuel and electricity  Farra said that the hospital typically burns thirteen hundred gallons of fuel a day to produce its own electricity during the frequent blackouts that afflict Gaza  Now the Israeli siege has entirely cut off the power  when we spoke  Farra said that there was only enough fuel left for two or three more days  To conserve power for surgeries and intensive care  the hospital had already shut off the electricity in many of its units  such as pediatrics and internal medicine   The mortuary refrigerators  of course  have stopped operating  so we can t hold on to the deceased and their numbers are big   Farra added   We are fearful that we will have to make mass graves   Najjar told us that another Gazan hospital was storing the dead in ice cream trucks  The New Yorker   Are you going to take austerity measures  Dr  Ayman al Farra   The maximum austerity measures have been taken  Electricity has been turned off in many units  The mortuary refrigerators  of course  have stopped operating  So we can t hold on to the deceased  We are fearful that we ll have to make mass graves  The lack of electricity is also threatening to close the dialysis unit  even though it now serves an influx of new patients from the north of Gaza   Thousands of people will die   Farra said  Without electricity  the pumps that draw water from the hospital s wells would also stop working   We re reaching the point in which we have to shut down   Farra said   The patients are going to die in front of us  and we re not going to be able to do anything   Early on October 20th  the Gaza Health Ministry sent out an  urgent distress call to all gas station owners and anyone who has any liter of diesel   asking for donations  to save the lives of the wounded and sick   Farra told us that  at the direction of Gaza s Health Ministry  hospital administrators have begun preserving resources by denying care that the hospital would normally provide to patients whose chances of recovery are considered slim   We make a decision not to put them on a ventilator  and we give the opportunity to someone who has hopes of living   The bodies of people killed by Israeli air strikes lie in a makeshift morgue outside the Nasser Medical Center  The bodies of people killed by

struggling patients from the intensive care unit  One was a ten year old boy whose brain had been penetrated by shrapnel   From his pupils  we were able to surmise that he was likely brain dead   he told us   We need beds for other patients    The boy died that night  Farra later confirmed   Other doctors did not want to discuss such painful trade offs  Abu Hatab  the head of maternal medicine  insisted that the hospital was denying care only rarely   If this happened with one or two cases  it would have been only after several doctors said that the case is totally hopeless   he told us  adding   Unfortunately  we ll have to do things that are very far away from ideal practices in medicine   But Farra and Najjar said that even the E R  is becoming increasingly selective about which incoming patients are given intensive care  Farra said that  the hopeless cases are given a place where they are followed closely  but they don t get the intervention that they normally would  Working with them will make us lose time that could be spent saving others   Najjar said that admitting a patient can take up to two hours because doctors must be persuaded to free up a bed by discharging another patient  On October 12th  a young boy had arrived at the hospital with a head wound that required surgery  but all the operating rooms were full and there was no free ventilator  which was needed to keep him alive  Najjar recalled   We were told there are no beds left in the intensive care unit  but we told the I C U    No  he has to go in  that won t work     After four hours of tense negotiations  the I C U  made a ventilator available for the boy by unplugging an older patient and transferring him to an oxygen tank  The boy s life was saved  Naggar told us  the older patient s fate was unclear  Doctors  too  are dying in Gaza  Najjar told us that he knew of several who had been killed by air strikes  the dean of his medical school  a friend who worked at a Gaza City hospital  a burn surgeon on a brief visit home  a family doctor  alongside her husband and her children  Another victim  an eminent pathologist  was a personal mentor of Najjar s  When he heard the news  he said   I couldn t hold myself together I walked over to a corner and started crying   Every couple of days  Najjar briefly leaves the hospital to check on his family  and he worries that a bomb might end his life on the way   You also see piles of trash around you  people sleeping on the ground outside  destroyed homes   he noted   All of this makes you anxious   On the fifth day of the war  Najjar heard the sound of a strike not far from the hospital  The first patient to reach the E R  was one of his relatives  He was badly bruised and burned in many places  and one of his hands had been wounded  The relative was conscious enough to convey that Najjar s parents who were staying in a house next to the site of the blast had survived  But the bombing killed five of their relatives  one of whom was disfigured beyond recognition  Najjar told us that a cousin had come to the hospital to identify the bodies  Injured children being treated at the Nasser Medical Center  Injured children being treated at the Nasser Medical Center  Photograph by Mohammed Talatene   dpa   AP  You try to hold it together   Najjar told us  But then  on October 17th  he heard the news that an explosion had destroyed the Arab Ahli hospital in Gaza City killing hundreds  according to initial reports   The Israeli military and U S  intelligence agencies say that a malfunctioning missile fired by Palestinian militants struck the Gaza City hospital  Hamas has blamed an Israeli air strike   At the same moment  several injured members of a prominent family in Khan Younis were arriving at Nasser Medical Center  Najjar told us   I wasn t able to endure it  I was supposed to help the wounded  but I went to a corner and fell to the ground   It took him ten minutes to regain his composure and resume treating patients  When Najjar was asked how he felt about Hamas which controls Gaza and the attack that triggered Israel s retaliation  he said that he could not answer  Associates of his told us that Najjar  like many young Palestinians  had long ago soured on the leadership of all the competing Palestinian political factions  To us  he said only that the ordeal of the war had destroyed what was left of the hope he had placed in  the international community   Najjar said   No one can get humanitarian aid in  how are they going to stop the war  How are they going to do justice for us and give us a state   The world powers  he said  were  biased for and afraid of Israel so where will the solution come from   Farra  the health official  was less guarded  He said that  about twenty years ago  he had worked for seven months on a cardiac ward at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center   Gadi Keren  an Israeli cardiologist there  warmly recalled working with Nasser staff   There are many great people in Gaza   he told us  He then said of Hamas   Unfortunately  this terror group is destroying the lives of more than two million    Farra told us that his experience of the world outside Gaza had reinforced his conviction that both Hamas and the Israeli military were wrong to target civilians  Hamas s assault on October 7th  he said  was  absolutely unacceptable   A

Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin  who in the nineteen nineties launched the Oslo Accords  which laid out a path to a two state solution   We want to live in peace  side by side  but killing entire families like this there won t be any chance for peace and coexistence left   he said   Extremism and narrow mindedness caused this catastrophe  and it will be reflected across the entire region  Every action has a reaction  Everyone who lost a family member wants to take revenge  On both sides  it leads to violence and extremism   Given Hamas s tight control of Gaza  very few residents have so openly criticized the assault  But Farra insisted that  despite the deaths caused by Israel s air strikes  there were many other Gazans who still shared his peaceable views   We are people who love life  Who love peace  These are deadly wars that are bringing destruction for everyone  \\nChicago area charity hopes to evacuate pediatrician working in Gaza

______________ Read more on the blog here\\nCNN   A senior doctor in northern Gaza says that dozens of medical staffers at his hospital have been taken to an undisclosed location by the Israeli military  as the enclave s wider healthcare system teeters on the edge of collapse  Dr  Hossam Abu Safia  head of pediatrics at Kamal Adwan Hospital  told CNN in a phone interview that the area where the facility is located saw particularly heaving bombing on Tuesday followed by the arrival of Israeli troops  describing the situation as  very dangerous   The troops told all men between the ages of 16 and 65 to leave the building to be searched  he said  More than 70 medical staff were  arrested and taken to an unknown area   according to Abu Safia  including hospital director  Dr  Ahmed Al Kahlot  His claim was echoed in a statement by Gaza s Hamas controlled Health Ministry  Al Kahlot had spoken to CNN less than 24 hours earlier  alleging that Israeli tank shells had hit the hospital s maternity ward on Monday  The strike killed two women and left two more so badly wounded their legs required amputation  he said at the time  CNN was unable to reach Dr  Al Kahlot on Tuesday  Asked about the arrests  the Israel Defense Forces said that it continues  to act against Hamas strongholds in the north of Gaza  among them the area of Beit Lahia   Kamal Adwan hospital is located in Gaza City  not Beit Lahia  The statement added that the IDF is taking  all feasible precaution to mitigate harm to non combatants  and is fighting against the Hamas terrorist organization  and not the civilians in Gaza or the medical teams operating there    Horrendous conditions  Israeli actions in and around hospitals in Gaza have come under fierce criticism  as medical workers and NGOS warn that the health system in the territory is barely functional and cannot tolerate any more strain  Last month  the Israeli army raided Gaza s largest hospital  Al Shifa  in search of conclusive proof of the large scale command and control center it had claimed was there  as doctors rushed to evacuate patients and dozens of newborn infants in need of incubators  The IDF subsequently brought some reporters to see the tunnels it had uncovered inside the hospital compound  which also included several small underground rooms  CNN has been shown the tunnel shaft but has not been inside the tunnels  At Al Rantisi children s hospital  medical staff were also told to leave  as the IDF conducted operations inside  Israeli military officials later alleged that one room in the building s basement was a Hamas armory  which had a handful of weapons and a chair with a rope next to it   a claim Gaza health officials denied  Many medical centers serve as shelters for displaced Gazans seeking safety  in addition to caring for patients  But those seeking refuge in hospitals are finding that  this is just not the case   Marie Aure Perreaut  the emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in the enclave  While hospitals as a category are protected by international law  they may be viewed as legitimate military targets if found to be housing able bodied combatants and weapons  The Israeli military has said it only carries out operations in and around hospitals where they are being used by Hamas and other armed groups  According to Dr  Abu Safia  he and just five other doctors were allowed to stay at Kamal Adwan Hospital to attend to patients in intensive care unit and premature babies   They asked us to gather in only one section or building  and  close all the doors and windows  and not to be near doors or windows   he said  But the care that the hospital s remaining staff can offer patients too weak to be moved has been minimal  he said   due to acute shortages of fuel  water  food  and medical supplies even before the siege   Today the hospital has no water or power  he added  noting that doctors are  working with primitive flashlights to follow up on the patients left in the hospital   Across the besieged enclave  only 11 hospitals remain even partially functional  according to Richard Peeperkorn  the World Health Organization s  WHO  representative in Gaza  in a press conference Tuesday   In just 66 days the health system has gone from 36 functional hospitals to 11 partially functional hospitals   so  one in the north and 10 in the south   he said  In the same day  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was  extremely worried  about  reports of a raid at Kamal Adwan Hospital in  Gaza after several days of siege   in a post on X  formerly known as Twitter  Several hospitals in northern Gaza have ceased operations in recent weeks  saying they received orders from the Israeli military to evacuate  The Israeli military disputes issuing such an order  Fuel shortages have forced several hospitals in Gaza to close  while others have shut down due to airstrike damage  according to the WHO \\nJNS org   As more details emerge from the Israel Defense Force s surprise raid on Shifa Hospital in Gaza City  which began on March 19  one thing has become clear  Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad absorbed a painful setback that will have strategic reverberations on their capabilities in northern Gaza  The IDF has categorized the raid as one of its most successful operations in the entire war  due to the number of terrorists who surrendered  the number of terrorists killed in the hospital complex  and the intelligence gleaned from those being questioned  So far  more than 180 terrorists inside Shifa and around the compound have been killed in the battle  and more than 500 have been arrested  including a string of senior terror commanders  These Israeli military achievements will have  a huge effect on Hamas and Islamic Jihad   IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm  Daniel Hagari told journalists on March 25  adding that it was the most enemy combatants killed and captured in a single raid in the war  which will cause  severe damage  to terror organizations in the northern Gaza Strip   It concerns Hamas very much to know who are the ones that we have arrested   said Hagari   And the numbers  the huge numbers  concern them most of all  This is why we keep on pressing  This is our target in the war  dismantling the armed elements  to do that with the operatives and also with the leadership   Senior terrorists captured Senior terrorists captured at Shifa include Bakr Ahmed Bakr Qanita  head of department in Hamas s Security and Protection Unit  Radwan Younes Kamal Tafesh  head of department in the Weapon Manufacturing Unit of Islamic Jihad  and Hashem Muhammad Hasan Albatash  responsible for the financial affairs of Islamic Jihad s Gaza City Brigade   These terrorists provide us with valuable intelligence during their interrogations that will lead us to further operations   Hagari said on March 26   And we keep on doing everything we can to kill the leadership of Hamas  And we are looking at following the intelligence  to other Hamas leaders whom we will capture or kill  I hope  in the future  This is a main effort for the IDF   Before launching the operation  the IDF used its intelligence units to learn how Shifa Hospital became  once again  a terror headquarters  This time  instead of the previous destruction of organized military Hamas structures in northern Gaza  the IDF took on smaller Hamas and PIJ cells that had taken over Shifa  During questioning by the IDF Intelligence Corps  Unit 504  captured terrorists said they returned to Shifa because they felt they d be secure there  and because there is electricity  running water and available food  Each terror organization took control of different hospital wards  intelligence has revealed  Hamas also took over the offices of the Shifa Hospital director  The IDF seized envelopes inside the hospital containing 11 million shekels   3 million  of terror financing  As such  Hamas and PIJ s hope to turn the hospital into a terrorist hornet s nest in northern Gaza has been shattered  There is no safe place for surviving cells in the area  and this message will further demoralize Hamas  The fight at Shifa is not over  Hundreds of terrorists have been killed and captured after they opened fire at the IDF from the hospital s courtyard  emergency room   Qatari Building  and maternity ward  Firefights continued on Wednesday as terrorists barricaded themselves in sections of the hospital  firing on Israeli forces and hurling explosives at them  Hamas s actions have caused heavy damage to the hospital compound  Earlier in the operation  Hamas terrorists in the hospital ordered cells outside of the hospital to fire mortars at the hospital buildings to try and force the IDF to evacuate it  according to Hagari  Remarkably  the IDF s operation has seen no harm come to a single patient  doctor  medical staff member  or civilian seeking refuge in the hospital  The IDF evacuated patients to a safer location where they are receiving medical treatment  The army also provided more than 1 000 types of medications  food and water to these patients  while assisting Palestinian medical teams  The military is proceeding with caution in an effort to avoid damaging the hospital and to secure its own forces on site  which include Israel Navy commandoes  Shayetet 13  and members of the 401st Brigade and the Nahal Reconnaissance Battalion  operating under the IDF s 162nd Division  which is managing operations in northern Gaza  Khan Yunis On Tuesday evening  the IDF announced that it had initiated what it described as a focused operation at Khan Yunis s Al Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza  The operation began following intelligence on Hamas activity in the hospital and was preceded by the safe evacuation of civilians  patients  and medical teams  The IDF is demonstrating that not only does it have freedom of movement and access to these sites  but also that Hamas and PIJ will hijack any possible facility to try and continue to function as a terrorist threat \\nPhoto Credit  Shin Bet The director of a Gaza hospital admitted to Israeli interrogators that he was recruited by

precipice of an unparalleled crisis  The hospital  which has catered to the health needs of innumerable Palestinians  is now gasping for resources to sustain its operations in the face of escalating conflict  With new patients flooding in ceaselessly and insufficient space to accommodate them  the hospital corridors have become makeshift wards  Severely limited supplies have left the hospital grappling with an acute shortage of pain medication  International Aid Amid Crisis A team from the World Health Organization  WHO  and other United Nations agencies managed to deliver medical supplies to the beleaguered hospital on a Saturday  However  the support provided is dwarfed by the magnitude of the crisis  The hospital is not only contending with grossly inadequate medical supplies but also faces a severe scarcity of clean water and food  further compounding the grim circumstances for patients and staff alike  Dire Conditions in Gaza The crisis in Gaza extends beyond the walls of Al Shifa hospital  Palestinian Americans  who have made Gaza their home  are unable to evacuate due to the ongoing conflict and Israel s blockade  The U S  government s support remains elusive  leaving

distressing statement regarding Gaza s Al Shifa hospital  describing its emergency department as a  bloodbath  in desperate need of resuscitation  The hospital  the largest medical facility in the Palestinian territory  has been severely impacted by Israeli bombardments amid the ongoing Israel Hamas conflict  According to the WHO  tens of thousands of displaced people have sought refuge in the hospital building and its grounds  exacerbating challenges such as a severe shortage of drinking water and food  The emergency department is overwhelmed  with hundreds of injured patients and new arrivals every minute  The grim conditions include patients with trauma injuries being treated on the floor  and the absence of available pain management  Due to the destruction caused by the attacks  Al Shifa hospital is operating at a minimal scale  and critical patients are being transferred to Al Ahli Arab Hospital for surgeries  The WHO emphasizes that the hospital needs urgent resuscitation  as only 30 patients can receive dialysis daily amidst ongoing attacks from Israel  The WHO plans to reinforce Al Shifa in the coming weeks to enable the resumption of basic services  Up to 20 operating theatres in the hospital  along with post operative care services  could be activated with regular supplies of fuel  oxygen  medicines  food  and water  The health infrastructure across the Gaza strip has been severely impacted by Israeli army bombardments since the October 7 attack by Hamas  The conflict has resulted in approximately 1 140 casualties  mostly civilians  and 240 hostages taken  Israel s retaliatory offensive has claimed 18 800 lives  predominantly women and children  Amid these dire circumstances  allegations persist that Hamas operates command centers below hospitals  although such claims are denied by hospital officials and Hamas  Currently  only Al Ahli Arab hospital in the northern region of Gaza Strip is partially functioning  while three facilities Al Shifa  Al Awda  and Al Sahaba Medical Complex are operating at a minimum capacity  Before the conflict  there were 24 operational health facilities in the region \\nBy Yoni Weiss The director of a Gaza hospital admitted to Shin Bet interrogators that he was recruited by Hamas to help turn the Gaza Strip s medical centers into military facilities  the Shin Bet announced on Tuesday  In a video released by the Shin Bet  Ahmed Kahlot  director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip  told his interrogator   I was recruited to Hamas in 2010 at the rank of lieutenant colonel  There are employees in the hospital who are military operatives of Ezz a Din Al Qassem  doctors  nurses  paramedics  clerks  and staff members   Kahlot added   They hide in hospitals because they believe that a hospital is a safe place  They will not be harmed if they are inside a hospital   Israel security forces arrested Kahlot last Tuesday  During the interrogation  Kahlot described how Hamas used hospitals and ambulances to hide terrorists  launch military activity  transport members of terror squads  and even deliver a kidnapped IDF soldier   Hamas has offices inside the hospitals  There are places for senior officials  they also brought a kidnapped soldier there  There is a designated place for investigations  internal security  and special security  They all have private phone lines inside the hospital   Kahlot said  Regarding the kidnapped soldier  Kahlot explained that  Hamas uses private ambulances  It has a different color  and no license plate  It was used to bring the kidnapped soldier and to transfer bodies  It comes and goes and does not take care of the wounded   Kahlot recalled   Once I begged them to take a wounded man to the Indonesian Hospital  for treatment  yet they refused  Their mission is more important   He added   The leaders of Hamas are cowards  They left us in the field while they hide in hiding places  They have destroyed us  \\ni24 News   The Israel Defense Forces  IDF  successfully concluded a strategic operation in the vicinity of the Kamal Adwan hospital  previously exploited by Hamas as a central command and control center in Jabalya  Over the past few days  IDF and ISA  Israel Security Agency  units carried out targeted actions  resulting in the apprehension of 90 terrorists and the discovery of a cache of various weapons  Among the captured militants were approximately 80 individuals directly involved in the October 7th massacre  showcasing the IDF s commitment to dismantling key elements of terrorist infrastructure  The operation included the destruction of terror related facilities in the area  The mission exposed the hospital s involvement in supporting terrorism  as IDF and ISA forces questioned hospital workers

described days of heavy fighting  mass arrests  forced marches past dead bodies and flattened buildings in interviews Sunday  The Israeli military says it has killed over 170 militants and detained some 480 suspects in the raid on Shifa Hospital that began last Monday  portraying it as a heavy blow to Hamas and other armed groups that it says had regrouped in the medical compound  But the heavy fighting has also highlighted the resilience of Palestinian armed groups in an isolated and heavily destroyed part of Gaza where troops have been forced to return after launching a similar raid back in November  Kareem Ayman Hathat  who lived with his parents and two brothers in a five story building about 100 meters  yards  from the hospital  said they huddled in the kitchen for days while gunfire and explosions echoed outside  sometimes causing the whole building to shake  Early Saturday  Israeli troops stormed the building and forced them and dozens of other residents to leave  He says the men were forced to strip to their underwear and four were detained  The rest were blindfolded and ordered to follow a tank south  as more blasts thundered around them   From time to time  the tank would fire a shell   he told The Associated Press in an interview from another hospital in central Gaza  where he has sought shelter   It was to terrorize us   The head of Israel s southern command  Maj  Gen  Yaron Finkelman  said the Shifa raid had been a  daring  tricky and most impressive operation so far   with  hundreds  of militants apprehend and the acquisition of valuable intelligence   We will finish this operation only when the last terrorist is in our hands   alive or dead   he added in a statement released by the military on Saturday  Shifa Hospital had largely stopped functioning following the raid in November  After claiming that Hamas maintained an elaborate command center inside and beneath the hospital  Israeli forces exposed a single tunnel leading to a few underground rooms  They also said they found weapons in parts of the hospital  Gaza City  where Shifa is located  suffered widespread devastation in the early days of Israel s offensive  launched after the Oct  7 Hamas attack that triggered the war  Israeli forces have isolated the city and the rest of northern Gaza since November  and hardly any aid has been delivered in recent weeks  Experts said last week that famine is imminent in northern Gaza  where over 210 000 people are suffering from catastrophic hunger  Jameel al Ayoubi  who was among thousands of people sheltering at Shifa when the raid commenced last Monday  said in a phone interview that tanks and armored bulldozers had plowed into the courtyard of the sprawling medical compound  crushing ambulances and civilian vehicles  He said he saw tanks driving over at least four bodies of people killed early in the raid  The Health Ministry said five wounded Palestinians trapped at Shifa had died without food  water or medical services  The World Health Organization s director general  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  described the conditions there as  utterly inhumane   The military said Saturday that it had evacuated patients and medical staff from Shifa s emergency department because militants had  entrenched  themselves in the building  The army said it had set up an alternative site where seriously wounded patients were receiving care  Abed Radwan  who lived some 200 meters  yards  from the hospital  said Israeli forces stormed all the buildings in the area  detaining several people and forcing the rest to march south  As he walked south with others  he saw dead bodies in the streets and several flattened homes   They left nothing intact   he said in an interview from a relative s house in central Gaza  Now in its sixth month  the war between Israel and Hamas has killed at least 32 226 Palestinians  according to Gaza s Health Ministry  It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its toll but says women and children make up around two thirds of the dead  Israel says it has killed over 13 000 militants  without providing evidence  It blames civilian casualties on Hamas  accusing it of using schools  hospitals and residential areas to shield its fighters  More than 80  of Gaza s population of 2 3 million have fled their homes  with most seeking refuge in the southernmost city of Rafah  which Israel says will be the next target of its ground offensive  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rebuffed calls from the United States and others to avoid launching a major ground operation there  saying it is essential for defeating Hamas  The war began when Hamas led militants stormed over the border on Oct  7 and rampaged across southern Israel  killing some 1 200 people  mostly civilians  and taking scores of people hostage  Hamas is still holding an estimated 100 hostages and the remains of 30 others  after most of the rest were freed in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners in November  The United States  Qatar and Egypt have been trying to broker another cease fire and hostage release  but weeks of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have failed to yield an agreement  ___ Magdy reported from Cairo  ___ Find more of AP s war coverage at https   apnews com hub israel hamas war\\nCasualties 32 070  killed  and at least 74 412 wounded

of al Shifa enters sixth day  airstrikes on Rafah kill 4 children Israel s siege on al Shifa Hospital has entered its sixth consecutive day  The government media office in Gaza released a statement saying it holds the U S  and the international community responsible for Israel s  crime  perpetrated against al Shifa s doctors  staff  patients  and the displaced people sheltering at the medical compound  As reported by Al Jazeera  the media office said that the Israeli army was bombing buildings inside the medical complex and engaging in acts of torture and extrajudicial field executions  The Israeli army claims it has arrested over 170 Hamas fighters and 800 suspects at al Shifa  Moreover  according to Al Jazeera  the Israeli army has reportedly set fire to the buildings around the hospital  The siege on al Shifa comes in the context of Israel s attempt to target civil employees and members of the police in Gaza who were based in al Shifa  in an attempt to sow civil unrest and cause a breakdown in social order in the north  Claiming these civil employees to be  top Hamas operatives   Israel assassinated the Director of the Operations of the Gaza Police  Faiq Mabhouh  on March 18  Mabhouh was an instrumental figure in successfully coordinating the delivery of humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in cooperation with international organizations  local tribes  and UNRWA  In light of the widespread compliance of the populace with the directives of Gaza s civil employees  Israel has laid siege to al Shifa  where many of them are based  Israel continues to claim that these civil and police employees are Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters  despite offering no evidence to back up its claims  The Gaza government media office said that the Israeli army has threatened al Shifa s hospital s staff and displaced civilians that the buildings they are staying in will be bombed in the event that they do not evacuate  The media office based its statement on testimonies from people who remain stranded inside the medical compound as Israel lays siege to it  asserting that those who have evacuated the buildings are either arrested  tortured  or killed  as reported by Middle East Eye  MEE also reported that six wounded patients in the hospital died amid the Israeli siege due to the lack of medical care  quoting the Gaza Ministry of Health as saying that  besieged medical teams and patients are appealing to UN institutions and the international community to intervene urgently to save their lives   In southern Gaza  Israel continued its airstrikes on Rafah and Khan Younis  killing several civilians  In one airstrike on the north of the city of Rafah  five civilians were killed  four of them children  following the bombing of a two story residential building in the Mirage area  reports Wafa  The number of casualties from Israeli airstrikes and shelling in the last 24 hours has risen to 72 people killed and 114 injured  Meanwhile  on Friday  the Israeli army released a statement on X saying that it had opened an investigation into the incident of the deliberate killing of four unarmed Palestinian men in civilian clothing in Khan Younis last February by an Israeli attack drone  the footage of which recently came to light after Al Jazeera obtained from sources in Gaza  The footage of the deliberate killing of the unarmed men made shockwaves  highlighting Israel s deliberate policy of killing civilians   The unbearable cannot become the new normal  In a statement on X  Philippe Lazzarini  head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency  UNRWA   said that food aid had been denied to northern Gaza for the second time in a week   Today  the Israeli Authorities denied another UNRWA convoy with much needed food supplies from going to the north where people are on the verge of famine   the UNRWA chief said   The last time UNRWA was able to send food aid to the north was nearly 2 month  sic  ago   Lazzarini went on to say that Israel the  man made hunger   looming famine  in Gaza could still be averted if Israel allowed  delivering food aid at scale to the north including via UNRWA  the largest humanitarian organisation in Gaza    Meanwhile  children will continue to die of malnutrition   dehydration under our watch   he added   The unbearable cannot become the new normal   By late afternoon  Al Jazeera correspondents reported that Israeli shelling on Palestinian aid seekers at the Kuwaiti roundabout had killed at least seven people  This latest attack on civilians at aid distribution points comes after the assassination of Faiq Mabhouh and Gaza s civil employees  who were instrumental in organizing orderly deliveries of aid to Gaza without resulting in these Israeli attacks on starving Palestinians  The most infamous of such attacks was the  Flour Massacre  on March 3  which killed over 100 people  Meanwhile  7 000 trucks carrying humanitarian aid and food aid are currently stationed outside the Rafah crossing  waiting to enter the besieged Gaza Strip  As reported by Al Jazeera  the governor of North Sinai  Muhammad Shousha  said that the Israeli inspection procedures are holding up the flow of trucks into Gaza  Shousha received UN General Secretary Antonio Guterres at al Arish Airport in the Egyptian Sinai for the UN chief s planned visit to the Rafah border crossing later today  During his press conference at the Rafah crossing  Guterres lambasted the blocking of aid to Gaza as a  moral outrage  and said that he had made his trip to the border to shed light on the pain of Palestinians in Gaza  New UN Security Council resolution postponed to Monday Following China and Russia s vetoing of the U S  led draft resolution for a Gaza ceasefire at the UN Security Council  a new resolution demanding an  immediate ceasefire  during Ramadan in advance of a more  permanent sustainable ceasefire  has been postponed to Monday  March 25  according to diplomatic sources that spoke to AFP  as reported on Al Mayadeen  In the earlier U S  led draft  China and Russia used their veto against the resolution  with Russia citing it as a  hypocritical spectacle  that contained an  effective green light  for Israel to continue its invasion of Rafah  while China believed that the resolution  dodged the most central issue  that of a ceasefire  through the use of nebulous language   The ambiguous language to which Russia and China referred was the resolution s emphasis on the  imperative of an immediate and sustained ceasefire   instead of demanding its implementation in the short term  The U S  resolution also condemned the Hamas led attacks on October 7  West Bank  resistance operation and record settlement expansion In the West Bank  Israeli settlement building has reached a record high  As reported by Middle East Eye  the United Nations and Israeli rights group Peace Now have asserted that in 2023  Israel expanded its settlements at a record pace in the occupied West Bank  According to Peace Now  ten out of the 26 illegal outposts established in the West Bank were built after October 7  resulting in the forcible displacement of 21 Palestinian communities  16 of which were uprooted since the outbreak of the war   Meanwhile  UN human rights chief Volker Turk asserted that the record expansion of settlements risks eliminating the chances for a Palestinian state  and that 24 300 new settlement housing units were built in 2023  a record high since the UN began monitoring in 2017  Yesterday  a Palestinian man from the village of Kufr Ni ma  west of Ramallah  launched a shooting operation against Israeli soldiers  injuring seven soldiers before an Israeli attack helicopter fired missiles on his position in the hills  killing him  New details have emerged since the incident that shed light on the nature of the resistance operation and detail the expertise of the shooter  identified as Mujahid Mansour  According to reports by Ynet and Quds News Network  Mansour had opened fire on a settler bus  resulting in no fatalities  before retreating and being chased by Israeli army vehicles  It would seem that Mansour was leading the soldiers into an ambush  perching himself on top of a hill and hiding behind trees and bushes  Mansour then proceeded to intermittently engage the forces with a sniper rifle from a distance  resulting in a standoff that lasted for five hours due to the inability of Israeli drones and helicopters to identify him as a result of poor weather  Mansour was able to down an Israeli drone with his rifle during the standoff  while at other times  he fell silent and maintained his cover  while the Israeli troops were reluctant to advance  An Israeli helicopter eventually launched a missile where he was hiding when the weather cleared  Reports have since emerged that Mansour was a member of the Palestinian Authority  PA  security forces  In preparation for the punitive demolition of Mansour s family home  the Israeli army took measurements for the house on Saturday  Wafa reported  This is part of Israel s larger policy of punitive home demolitions  in which the Israeli army destroys the homes of the families of Palestinians who launched attacks against Israel  which has been described as a policy of collective punishment \\nIsraeli troops killed six Palestinians in the occupied West Bank on Saturday  the Palestinian Ministry of Health said  A 25 year old doctor was killed early in the morning outside his home in Qabatiya  near Jenin  a stronghold of Palestinian armed groups in the north of the

public hospital and the Ibn Sina clinic  and that soldiers were searching ambulances  They also reported heavy fighting with automatic weapons  The West Bank has seen an uptick in violence since the October 7 cross border attack on Israel by Hamas last month  in which militants from the Gaza Strip killed 1 200 people  most of them civilians  according to the Israeli authorities  Israel has since responded with a bombing and land campaign in Gaza  killing nearly 15 000 people  also mostly civilians  according to the Hamas government  All the while  some 230 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli settlers and soldiers  according to the Palestinian Authority s Ministry of Health \\nTwo patients have died without access to care in the emergency unit of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza  said the Palestinian Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al Qidra on Thursday morning  They died due to the Israeli military which  amid a complete invasion and occupation

conducting ground operations in the strip gradually surrounding Kamal Adwan   one of the few still partially functioning hospitals in northern Gaza   followed by a full scale invasion on Tuesday  All of the men at the hospital  including displaced people  medical staff  wounded individuals  and patients have been arrested by the Occupation and interrogated under torture and severe beatings  announced the Palestinian Health Ministry s official Telegram channel on Wednesday afternoon  Women staff were released on Wednesday following their arrest Tuesday  said a United Nations report  Some of the detainees were released  but as they were returning to the hospital they were shot at  resulting in the injury of five individuals  said the ministry s statement  The fate of the remaining detainees remains unknown  Hospital Director Ahmed al Kahlout is still under arrest  said Qidra on Thursday  as one of 70 people still held by the Occupation forces in an unknown location  according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs situation report  A spokesperson for the Occupation forces claimed on Thursday that 70 people who surrendered to the Occupation military and intelligence forces at the Kamal Adwan Hospital were Hamas  activists   noting that they had been taken away for investigation  Similar claims emerged from the Occupation last week  Images were broadcast on Israeli TV showing detainees stripped of their clothes in Jabalia  Officials claimed that they were Hamas members  Yet Palestinian family members and relatives identified some of the detainees from the images  denying that they had any links to Hamas  Kamal Adwan Hospital is in Beit Lahia  one of the areas in northern Gaza that has become unrecognizable under over two months of relentless airstrikes and in the grip of the Occupation s ground invasion  Last week  the hospital was besieged by Occupation ground troops  its surroundings subject to shelling and gunfire  movement inside restricted and the supply of water  food and electricity to all of its departments cut off  Twelve children are still in the hospital s pediatric intensive care unit without life support devices or milk  putting their lives at risk  said the ministry on Wednesday  2 500 displaced people who were taking shelter in the hospital have also been forced to leave  said Qidra  Around 86 percent of Gaza s population  or as many as 1 9 million people  are thought to have been displaced from their homes thus far  Many of those displaced in Israel s ongoing assault on the strip have gathered at the remaining hospitals for shelter  Hospitals have been a major target in the Occupation aggression  with invasions similar to that taking place at Kamal Adwan targeting the Shifa Medical Complex and the Awda Hospital in Jabaliya  At present  only 11 out of the strip s 36 hospitals are operational  with aid organizations flagging that amid the lack of healthcare  resources and overcrowded conditions  disease is spreading fast and likely to kill as many as the 18 000 people who have been killed by Israel \\n Hamas Took Over   Housed Hostage   Watch Gaza

calling for ceasefire  Israeli Defense Minister prepares for trip to Washington The United States has introduced a UN Security Council resolution that calls for a  permanent and sustained  ceasefire with the strongest language that the United States has used to date  While the United States has voted against UNSC resolutions calling for a ceasefire as recently as February  this resolution marks a shift in priorities  bringing up concerns about famine and widespread conflict induced epidemics in Gaza as well as a need for Hamas to release all Israeli hostages    The draft resolution  is not calling for an immediate ceasefire now  it s not demanding an immediate ceasefire   Marc Owen Jones  associate professor of Middle East Studies at Hamid Bin Khalifa University  told Al Jazeera   So  it s still being slightly cautious with the language  But it certainly suggests that they believe that they could be getting one   U S  Congress member Rashida Tlaib   the only U S  Congressperson of

prolong Palestinian suffering   What we are witnessing  all around this world  is the Israeli government using starvation as a weapon of war  The starvation is a result of the total siege on Gaza and the international targeting of local food production  infrastructure and obstruction of aid convoys   European leaders have taken a cue from the United States to also re evaluate their priorities  overcoming their differences for the first time since October to agree upon a statement that calls for an immediate humanitarian pause  with the idea that this will lead to a permanent ceasefire  Many are cautiously optimistic that U S  Secretary of State Anthony Blinken s flash visit to Israel might result in a ceasefire announcement   or at least  the furthering of negotiations with a goal of stalling or avoiding a catastrophic military invasion of Rafah  However  Al Jazeera has pointed out that while the U S  drafted resolution calls for a  permanent and sustained  ceasefire  the phrasing remains nebulous as it leaves out calls of an  immediate  ceasefire  Meanwhile  Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is set to visit Washington next week with a  wish list  of weapons to be delivered

war Israeli soldiers fighting in Gaza mistakenly shot dead three Israeli hostages  the IDF said  Follow the latest news on the Israel Gaza war  A U S  intelligence assessment has found almost half of the munitions Israel has used in Gaza since the war began have been unguided bombs  a ratio that some arms experts say helps explain the conflict s enormous civilian death toll  Hostages  More than 100 held in the Gaza Strip have been released  Here s what we know about those released by Hamas so far  Oct  7 attack  Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel  A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel s reliance on technology at the  Iron Wall   the security barrier around the Gaza Strip  to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel s history  Traders earned millions of dollars anticipating the Oct  7 Hamas attack  a study found  Israeli Palestinian conflict  The Hamas controlled Gaza Strip has a complicated history  Understand what s behind the Israel Gaza war and see the history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict \\nIn a recent analysis conducted by The Washington Post  doubts have been raised about the Israeli Occupation government s assertions regarding the military use of al Shifa Hospital by Hamas  The Israeli Occupation claims  which were detailed and specific  suggested that the hospital served as a command and control center for Hamas activities  backed by what Israeli Occupation Forces  IOF  spokesperson Daniel Hagari described as  concrete evidence   However  The Washington Post s scrutiny of open source visuals  satellite imagery  and publicly released IOF materials indicates a lack of substantial evidence supporting these claims  Key findings include the absence of immediate signs of military use in rooms connected to the tunnel network discovered by IOF troops  no apparent connection between the hospital buildings and the tunnel network  and a lack of evidence showing that the tunnels could be accessed from inside hospital wards  The Washington Post s analysis sheds light on the legality and proportionality of Israeli Occupation s military operations against al Shifa  raising questions about the civilian harm caused during the encirclement  siege  and eventual raid of the facility and its underlying tunnel  The al Shifa Hospital complex  Gaza s most advanced and well equipped medical facility  played a crucial role in providing health services and shelter for displaced Gazans during the aggression  The situation at al Shifa has broader implications  as experts warn that the precedent set by targeting a medical facility poses risks for the future  The targeting of hospitals in Gaza has become a concerning pattern  with almost half of the major medical facilities in northern Gaza targeted or damaged in the recent aggressiob  This includes the effective destruction of Kamal Adwan Hospital and the besieging of Al Awda Hospital  The Washington Post s analysis calls for a more comprehensive understanding of the events at al Shifa and emphasizes the need to scrutinize military actions against medical facilities to ensure compliance with international laws of war  The situation remains a critical case study  highlighting the delicate balance between military operations and the protection of civilian infrastructure  especially medical facilities that are afforded special status even during times of conflict \\nAn Israeli soldier who survived a grenade explosion and then took out the Hamas terrorist who threw it in a close combat confrontation caught on camera said he had no other option but to attack  even after he was injured by the blast  In a video filmed from his hospital bed and released by the Israel Defense Forces on Monday  the unidentified reservist in the Combat Engineering Corps  elite Yahalom unit recalled the harrowing shootout that played out inside an apartment in Gaza City s Shejaiya neighborhood   There is an explosion   the soldier recalled of the grenade that detonated in front of him  as he was backed into the corner of a balcony   And I understand that if I don t go out now  I will either continue to receive grenades or I ll get shot   The footage of the attack  posted on social media last week  begins with a barrage of gunfire as the soldier takes down one militant inside an apartment  Speaking in the video released on Monday  the soldier recalled how listened to his comrades fire upon the terrorist   They throw grenades     I hear gunshots from outside   he said   I understand that they are trying to decide what to do in the situation and I am waiting   When he looks back through a doorway  he fires back at one of the operatives  he said   He starts to shoot in a slightly more aggressive way  to give more gunfire   he said  Bullets from another Hamas operative push the soldier back  and as he stands in the corner  the grenade explodes in front of him  The screen goes black as the soldier is knocked off his feet  Though it is hard to see through the smoke  the soldier gets back up and fires a shot into the apartment  the video shows  He then walks inside quietly  before he is confronted by a second gunman and shoots him  The terrorist can be seen falling backwards as the clip ends   The guys catch me and start the evacuation process   the soldier recalled   And here we are   Israeli forces have been locked in close quarters skirmishes around northern Gaza with Hamas  The battles come amid Israel s ongoing offensive in Gaza in retaliation against Hamas for their Oct  7 terror attacks  which saw some 1 200 people killed  another 240 taken hostage and atrocities committed against civilians  The Hamas run Health Ministry has said meanwhile that Israel s retaliatory attacks have left more than 18 000 dead in Gaza \\nThe Israeli war on Gaza entered its 72nd day with renewed Israeli airstrikes on civilian targets in the strip and fierce battles against Palestinian resistance factions reported  22 30 In a recent massacre in the northern Gaza Strip  more than 30 civilians were killed  and numerous others sustained injuries during Israeli airstrikes on Jabalia town tonight  as reported by local and medical sources  Sources told Palestinian news agency WAFA that the airstrikes specifically targeted a residential block in Jabalia town  resulting in the killing of at least 30 people and leaving dozens more injured  Additionally  there are reports of several people missing  adding to the gravity of the situation  Tragically  in another distressing attack  at least eight more people were killed  including two children and a woman  and numerous others sustained injuries during Israeli aerial raids  These airstrikes specifically targeted the home of a family in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza  Additionally  several people were killed and others injured in an Israeli bombardment that targeted a residence owned by a family  also situated in the Nuseirat camp  Israeli warplanes conducted attacks on multiple locations within the al Maghzazi refugee camp  as well as areas in the al Tuffah neighbourhood in northern Gaza  Furthermore  the Israeli military recommenced its artillery shelling  focusing on central and eastern areas of Khan Yunis city in the southern Strip  In this renewed assault  the artillery shells targeted a residence in Deir al Balah in the central Strip  19 30 The Karm Abu Salem border crossing between Israel and Gaza opened on Sunday for aid trucks for the first time since the outbreak of war  officials said  a move intended to double the amount of food and medicine reaching the enclave  The crossing had been closed since October 7  and aid was being delivered solely through Gaza s Rafah crossing with Egypt  which Israel said could only accommodate the entry of 100 trucks per day  Two sources in the Egypt Red Crescent told Reuters that trucks were starting to enter on Sunday through the Karm Abu Salem crossing on their way into Gaza  One said there were 79 trucks  Karm Abu Salem  on the border of Egypt  Israel and Gaza  is one of the main transit points for goods in and out of Gaza  allowing much faster transit than the Rafah passenger crossing a few kilometres away  Israel approved the entry of aid last week   Starting today  Dec 17   UN aid trucks will undergo security checks and be transferred directly to Gaza via Karm Abu Salem  to abide by our agreement with the US   COGAT  the branch of the occupation military which coordinated humanitarian aid with the Palestinian territories  said in a statement  18 00 Israeli forces bulldozed injured and displaced Palestinians who were sheltering on the grounds of Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia in north Gaza on Saturday  killing at least 20 and injuring more  according to eyewitnesses  Doctors  local journalists  and other witnesses said the Israeli army bulldozed displaced Palestinians sheltering in tents on the hospital grounds  crushing many to death and injuring others   They raided the building  and they took all the employees for investigation  also the injured people were being investigated   said Ahmed Al Kahlout  a doctor at the hospital  A video uploaded by Al Jazeera videographer and reporter Anas Al Sharif showed scenes of the destroyed courtyard  including what appeared to be human remains buried under bricks and rubble  In the video  Al Sharif explained that Israeli forces had withdrawn  but that  a major despicable act occurred at Kamal Adwan   Showing what appeared to be the partially buried limb of one victim to the camera  he said   This is the body of an injured refugee who was in the hospital   the Israeli bulldozers ran him over    We cannot describe the situation   tens of bodies run over by Israeli bulldozers   Al Sharif said as the camera panned around the yard  showing body parts amid heaps of rubble  Ahram Online could not

communications were cut on Thursday  15 30 Six fuel trucks and 40 aid trucks crossed Egypt s Rafah border crossing into the Gaza Strip on Sunday  according to Al Qahera News  In addition  four injured Palestinians arrived in Rafah  coming from the besieged strip  to receive treatment in the Egyptian hospitals  On Friday  Israel approved the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip through the Karm Abu Salem crossing  following pressure from the United States  Israel undertook this step during a visit by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan to the occupied Jerusalem  who pressed officials to reopen the crossing  Before the war  the Karm Abu Salem crossing  located in the southern corner of Gaza  at its border with Israel and Egypt  had been the primary commercial route for goods entering and exiting Gaza  On Tuesday  Egypt announced that it will start using the Karm Abu Salem border crossing for processing aid into the strip under an agreement with Israel  Since the start of the war  Egypt has called on the international community to pressure Israel to keep the Rafah border crossing to Gaza open permanently to deliver aid to the strip  International aid organizations say Gaza needs hundreds of humanitarian aid trucks daily as 2 4 million Palestinians in Gaza face near starvation conditions due to an all out Israeli blockade on the strip since 7 October 14 30 Israel s military said on Sunday that two more Israeli soldiers were killed in fighting in the Gaza Strip  bringing the official number of soldiers who have died since Israel launched its ground offensive in Gaza to 121  Military officials acknowledged on Saturday that three Israeli captives were mistakenly shot by Israeli troops  It was Israel s first such acknowledgement of harming its captives in a war that it claims is largely aimed at rescuing them  The three hostages  all in their 20s  were killed Friday in the Gaza City area of Shijaiyah  where troops are engaged in fierce fighting with Palestinian resistance fighters  13 30 The emergency department at the Al Shifa hospital in northern Gaza  devastated by Israeli bombardments  is  a blood bath  and is  in need of resuscitation   the WHO said  In a statement  the WHO said that  tens of thousands of displaced people are using the hospital building and shelter grounds   and that there is  a severe shortage  of drinking water and food   The WHO team described the emergency department as a  bloodbath   with hundreds of injured patients inside  and new patients arriving every minute   the organization said  adding that  patients with trauma injuries were being sutured on the floor     and  no pain management is available   The hospital is functioning at a minimal scale with very few staff and the WHO said  critical patients are being transferred to Al Ahli Arab Hospital for surgeries   Israel besieged and bombarded Al Shifa Medical Complex  the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip  for weeks before raiding the facility and

Paris on Saturday condemned an Israeli strike in Gaza that killed a French foreign ministry employee  demanding that  light be shed  on the circumstances  Colonna is also due to meet the families of French captives still held in Gaza and to call for an  immediate and durable new humanitarian truce   according to a foreign ministry statement  The truce should lead to a lasting ceasefire to release all hostages and deliver aid to Gaza  it said  Pro Palestinian demonstrators take part in a rally in front of the US embassy in Jakarta on December 17  2023  AFP 11 45 UK foreign minister David Cameron and German counterpart Annalena Baerbock on Saturday said the  need is urgent  for a  sustainable ceasefire  in Gaza  The two ministers have published a joint article under the title  Calling for a truce is easy  The details will be the tough part  in The Sunday Times in the UK and Welt am Sonntag in Germany  calling for a  sustainable  ceasefire  saying the goal must be peace lasting  generations   The article reads   Our goal cannot simply be an end to fighting today  It must be peace lasting for days  years  and generations  We therefore support a ceasefire  but only if it is sustainable    We know many in the region and beyond have been calling for an immediate ceasefire  We recognise what motivates these heartfelt calls    It is an understandable reaction to such intense suffering  and we share the view that this conflict cannot drag on and on  That is why we supported the recent humanitarian pauses   The article marked a significant shift in tone for the two European powers toward the Israeli war on Gaza  In the early days of the conflict  both the UK and German prime ministers visited Tel Aviv to demonstrate unconditional solidarity with Israel in its announced war objectives against Hamas  Building on this stance  in the following weeks  both London and Berlin vehemently opposed all calls for an immediate ceasefire in the war  However  in recent weeks  both the UK and German governments have come under increasing domestic pressure to withdraw their support for the Israel war on Gaza  In the UK  hundreds of thousands have been joining mass weekly protests

Thursday reported fighting in the area of the Shifa Hospital in Gaza City  as well as in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip  The health ministry in the Hamas run Gaza Strip said Thursday that 62 Palestinians had been killed during the previous day  The ministry said at least 32 552 people have been killed during Israel s counteroffensive  which began in October after a Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1 200 people  In a reversal  Israel agreed Wednesday to send its war strategists to Washington to discuss its intention to launch a ground assault on Hamas militants in the southern Gaza city of Rafah  On Monday  Israel had called off the trip in protest of the U S  refusal to veto a U N  Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease fire in the Israeli Hamas war  The United States  Israel s staunchest ally in the nearly six month war  abstained from this week s U N  vote after vetoing similar resolutions earlier  That drew a rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  evidence of a growing split with Washington over Israel s conduct of the war  But even as Netanyahu called off a trip by one set of his war strategists  Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was in Washington for talks this week with U S  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken  Netanyahu has said a Rafah attack is necessary to erase any Hamas control of Gaza  the narrow enclave along the Mediterranean Sea  But the U S  has told Israel it is opposed to a Rafah invasion  especially since more than a million Palestinian civilians are sheltered there in makeshift tents and structures  Israel has said it will move the Palestinians to safety before any attack on four Hamas battalions based in Rafah  but it has not indicated where it would send them  While maintaining that the U S  abstention was  very  very bad   Netanyahu told visiting U S  Republican Senator Rick Scott that his initial cancellation of the Israeli delegation s trip  was a message first and foremost to Hamas  Don t bet on this  United Nations  pressure  for a cease fire   It s not going to work   Netanyahu said the Security Council vote  encouraged Hamas to take a hard line and to believe that international pressure will prevent Israel  from achieving its war aims  Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the Hamas military is destroyed and the remaining 100 or so hostages it is holding are freed  The White House said that it was  a good thing  to hold more talks with Israeli officials and that a date is being discussed  Senator Roger Wicker  the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  said Thursday he and 10 other Republican senators have expressed their concern to U S  President Joe Biden that planning for the temporary pier to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza has not taken into account U S  force protection   We are gravely concerned that the Department of Defense has given too little consideration to the likelihood that Hamas  Palestinian Islamic Jihad  PIJ   and other U S  designated terrorist organizations operating in Gaza would attempt to attack the U S  personnel that will be deployed to this mission   the senators said in a letter dated March 21  They went on to note the pier will only add to ports of entry already backlogged with humanitarian aid deliveries  The war started with the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1 200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages  More than 100 were released in November during a weeklong cease fire  The death toll from the health ministry in Gaza includes Hamas fighters and civilians  with the ministry saying two thirds of the dead are women and children  The ministry says in addition to those killed  nearly 75 000 other people have been injured  Some information in this report came from The Associated Press  Reuters and Agence France Presse \\nCNN   Israeli forces last week launched another military operation on Gaza s largest hospital  Al Shifa  bringing the sprawling medical facility north of the enclave back into the spotlight  Now in its 11th day  the operation is the second of its kind at the hospital  which sits in the western part of northern Gaza City  The Israel Defense Forces  IDF  first raided Al Shifa in November  an operation in which the facility s main building was heavily damaged and effectively ceased to function  The raid also comes despite the IDF in January claiming it had completed dismantling Hamas  command structure in northern Gaza  While the IDF said civilians  patients  and medical teams were evacuated during the operation  Palestinians inside Al Shifa and around it have reported civilian casualties and arrests  as well as large scale destruction at the complex  Heavy fighting around the hospital has also been reported by Israel  Hamas and civilians  with United Nations officials saying hospitals must not be battlegrounds  Here s what we know  Why are the Israeli forces raiding Al Shifa again  Israeli forces began their most recent operation there on March 18  saying they are conducting  precise operational activities against terrorists  located at Al Shifa   a statement also echoed in November s raid  The IDF had returned in force to Al Shifa despite Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in January announcing that the most intensive phase of operations in northern Gaza was complete  Speaking to his troops in a video shared by the Defense Ministry  Gallant on March 26 hailed the operation  saying the hospital was reached  in a flash  and that Hamas operatives still holed up at the hospital  are considering their future  surrender or death   Throughout its 11 day operation  the Israeli military this month said it had detained hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants in and around the hospital  killing dozens of others  Around Al Shifa  the IDF said in an update Wednesday   approximately 200 terrorists have been eliminated in the area of the hospital since the beginning of the activity   The IDF also claimed that  terrorists fired at IDF troops from within and outside of the ER  emergency room  building at the Shifa Hospital   CNN is unable to verify these numbers  Israel has for years claimed that Hamas fighters are sheltering in mosques  hospitals and other civilian places to avoid Israeli attacks  Hamas has repeatedly denied the claims  Israeli officials have echoed the accusations since October 7  and following their first raid in November escorted CNN into Gaza to see a newly exposed tunnel shaft discovered at the compound of Al Shifa Hospital  The evidence did not establish without a doubt that there was a Hamas command center underneath the hospital as Israel had claimed  What are Palestinians saying  Some 3 000 people were sheltering in Al Shifa at the time of the recent raid  the ministry of health in Gaza said  adding that those attempting to leave were being targeted by snipers and fire from helicopters  Hamas accused Israel of striking targets  without regard  to the patients or medical staff inside   a claim echoed by people at the complex  Hundreds of those sheltering remained stranded inside the hospital for days   with little food or water   and warned by the Israeli military that they would be shot if they left the hospital without first receiving instructions to evacuate  Eyewitnesses said medical personnel and other civilians were detained by Israeli troops  Palestinian residents leave the area with a few items after Israeli forces besiege the Al Shifa hospital with tanks and heavy gunfire in Gaza City  Gaza on March 18  2024  Dawoud Abo Alkas Anadolu Getty Images Residents of the area around Al Shifa told CNN there was heavy firing in the vicinity  One family said their home was shelled  and that children   some still alive   were buried under the rubble  Targeting hospitals in wartime is prohibited under international law  but those standards change if enemy combatants are using the facility to attack an enemy  One eyewitness said that  on the eve of the raid  they spotted hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad members inside the hospital  The eyewitness  who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals  estimated about 400 to 500 Hamas and Islamic Jihad members and their families arrived at the hospital in mid March  Some of them appeared to be members of Hamas  political branch  while others were armed militants  The eyewitness said some of the militants were carrying guns inside the hospital  CNN is unable to independently verify the numbers due to lack of reporting access to the strip  and has asked the Gaza health ministry for comment  Allegations of torture and abuse More traumatic accounts have since emerged from people who have recently escaped Al Shifa or are still trapped there  A Palestinian paramedic who was detained by the Israeli military for three days at Al Shifa claims he was stripped naked and left outside in the cold  an assertion made by other men who have been released from the area  He says he was also beaten and prevented from using the bathroom  Mohammad Al Shawwa  in his 30s  told CNN he and his family were sheltering inside the hospital when they awoke to the sound of drones  bulldozers and heavy gunfire on March 18  as the Israeli military raided the complex   The army came to us and forced us out one by one  They stripped us naked and seated us in the yard  It was raining and unbelievably cold   Al Shawwa told CNN  speaking in the courtyard of the nearby Al Ahli Baptist Hospital  on Thursday   They tied our hands and blindfolded us  They humiliated us and beat us   Al Shawwa  in his 30s  alleged   They bulldozed the cemetery in the yard and dug up all the graves  all the dead bodies of the martyrs were dug up   Al Shawwa claims that the IDF eventually told him to leave Al Shifa  and he walked for two kilometers to Al Ahli Baptist Hospital  east of Gaza City   I ran away with other guys between the vehicles  partly blindfolded and tied   the paramedic said  CNN has previously asked the IDF about the movement of displaced people to Al Ahli Baptist Hospital  Al Shawwa says he was forced to leave his relatives behind  He says the fate of his mother  a cancer patient  sister  wife and son is unknown   after the family was separated during their detention  He is especially worried about his father  aged 60  who  he says   was taken by the army    I don t know if they are alive or dead   he told CNN  CNN has asked the IDF about Al Shawwa s claims of mistreatment  Meanwhile a doctor who cared for patients trapped inside Al Shifa told CNN he fears two severely malnourished siblings will not survive due to lack of care and medication  Dr Ali Alghaliz  an emergency doctor  treated Rafiq Dughmosh  15  and his sister  Rafif Dughmosh  13  at Al Shifa Hospital  before the Israeli military laid siege to the complex on March 18  Alghaliz was not at the hospital when the raid began  Both siblings had limbs amputated after surviving an Israeli airstrike on their home which killed their mother and 10 other relatives  according to the UK based NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians  MAP   The IDF forced their uncle  Mahmoud  to evacuate the hospital  added MAP  They have been left without a guardian inside the hospital  said Alghaliz  Alghaliz told CNN that he spoke to Rafiq on the phone on Monday night  The two children have been left without food  medication or wound dressing for more than one week  Alghaliz said in written messages on Wednesday and Thursday   Rafiq was crying   added Alghaliz  after developing bed sores because of the lack of care and dressing   I hope he will not be dead by the end of this siege  I have fears that he might get septic shock that will end his life   The Palestinian boy  feels desperate   he said   He told me   Now look at me Dr Ali  the bed sores are getting worse  the bad odor is coming from the sores  and from my amputated limbs  I feel I m going to die    Alghaliz said he hopes both siblings will be evacuated   I couldn t hold my tears when he spoke to me  but what can I do   What is the international community saying  World Health Organization  WHO  Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus condemned the raid  saying  hospitals should never be battlegrounds    We are terribly worried about the situation at Al Shifa Hospital in northern  Gaza  which is endangering health workers  patients and civilians   Ghebreyesus wrote March 18 on X  He also called for the protection of hospitals and a cessation of hostilities  WHO and other humanitarian groups had been warning of an ever nearing famine in northern Gaza  Israel s closest ally  the US  has repeatedly backed Israeli assessments that Hamas and other Gaza militants used Al Shifa s medical complex as a command hub  as well as to hold hostages and store weapons  Asked about attack on Al Shifa  US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on March 18 said that  Hamas came back into Shifa  after Israel had cleared the hospital of the militant group  Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant meets with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on March 26  2024  Jacquelyn Martin AP  Israel cleared Shifa once  Hamas came back into Shifa  which raises questions about how to ensure a sustainable campaign against Hamas so that it cannot regenerate  cannot retake territory   Sullivan told reporters  adding that from the US perspective  the operation is  connecting Israel s objective to a sustainable strategy  rather than have Israel go smash into Rafah   The US has been calling on Israel to find a way to protect civilians displaced in the southernmost city of Rafah  ahead of a planned Israeli incursion there  On the day of the raid  the top US humanitarian aid official called a report warning that famine is set to break out in northern Gaza  a horrific milestone  and urged Israel to open more land routes to deliver aid into the enclave  The  catastrophic levels of hunger and malnutrition  detailed in the report  should be unimaginable in the current era  but for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza  this is the reality   US Agency for International Development  USAID  Administrator Samantha Power said in a statement \\nText size The Israeli army said Saturday it had discovered weapons and arrested around 80 Hamas members in military  activity  at a hospital in Gaza  which Hamas described as a  horrific massacre   The Hamas controlled health ministry said on Wednesday that Israeli forces had  fired at patient rooms  and arrested staff at the Kamal Adwan hospital in Gaza City during a  siege  that lasted several days  The UN humanitarian agency OCHA said the same day that the hospital director and about 70 other medical staff were  detained in an unknown location outside of the hospital   It said Israeli forces had released five doctors and female staff but there were reports of  ill treatment  of those who had been held  On Saturday  the Israeli army said it had  completed its activity in the area of the Kamal Adwan hospital   which it charged  had been used by Hamas as a command and control centre    The troops apprehended approximately 80 terrorists    destroyed terror infrastructure in the area  and found  numerous weapons   the army said  Troops also  questioned the hospital workers   it said   The workers confessed that weapons were hidden in incubators    that were supposed to be used to treat premature babies   the army claimed  In a statement Saturday  Hamas accused Israeli troops of having carried out a  horrific massacre  inside the hospital and said they had destroyed  with bulldozers the tents of the displaced people  sheltering there  causing a  number of deaths   The Hamas government has said that at least 18 800 people have been killed in the territory since the outbreak of the war  which was triggered by the group s bloody attack on Israel on October 7  That attack left around 1 140 people dead  according to official figures  bur cgo bg lcm jd kir\\nBy Palestine Chronicle Staff Over 100

coming in and distributed to the people of Gaza  to which the woman replied   Hamas take everything to their homes   The reporter said   It seems that the situation is unclear   During another portion

hostage in Gaza who was freed in late November  hints at having been subject to sexual abuse during her time in captivity but says she is not yet ready to talk about it in detail   There was this constant fear of being raped at any moment  And then a day passes  and another one passes  So you prepare yourself   you neglect yourself   she says   I m not especially beautiful  I don t smell very good at all  You know  so that you repel them  I m old  I m 40  I m  hatiar    she tells Channel 12 s  Uvda  investigative program  using an Arab slang term that means old person  Yanai  40  was taken from the Supernova festival at Kibbutz Re im on October 7  It was the scene of a bloody massacre of some 360 people and widespread abductions by Hamas terrorists  She returned with 104 others over the course of a weeklong truce in late November  after some 50 days as a hostage in Gaza  Her testimony offers a window into the hesitancy of some sexual assault survivors to open up publicly about their deeply personal suffering  amid attempts by some anti Israel activists and international media outlets to cast doubt on claims of rape and other sexual abuses by Hamas terrorists on October 7 and in captivity in Gaza  Yanai says their captors would make them  go through  necessary   bodily  inspection when we d arrive at certain places   declining to elaborate   From my point of view  the sexual harassment I suffered doesn t quite fit the definition of the term   she says  becoming emotional   When  the hostages  come back  I will deal with the accurate definition of it    For me  right now  I have to dissociate myself from it  Because however you look at it  they took away your freedom  they took everything  you have nothing  nothing is really yours  you don t belong to yourself  The only thing that belongs to you is what you have up here   she gestures to her head  Yanai reveals that she was held with Noa Argamani  26  who was also taken from the music festival on October 7  Argamani was seen in one of the first Hamas videos released during the massacre at the Supernova desert rave  seated on the back of a motorcycle behind her Hamas captor  screaming   Don t kill me   Yanai says she left thinking that Argamani would also be released in the coming days and feels immense guilt for being the one to go free  The moment in November when the captors told them that one of them would be freed was  absolutely terrible   she says   It was like a reality show  They sat us down  A terrorist comes in and says  One of you is going home    she gestures with her finger from one person to the other to demonstrate a selection process  She also reveals that she was held at least part of the time with Itay Svirsky  38  who was killed in captivity   I m not  really  here   she says  Everything I do  drinking coffee  shopping  strolling  for a moment it  may  bring a smile to my face because it s pleasant but then it falls after a second because I remember that there s someone  a female hostage  who is sitting on the same mattress you sat on until just a moment ago  \\nGaza s Kamal Adwan Hospital  Effectively Destroyed   WHO Warns of Healthcare Crisis The Kamal Adwan Hospital  a vital medical facility situated in northern Gaza  has been  effectively destroyed   according to the World Health Organization  WHO   This catastrophic development has plunged the region s healthcare infrastructure into a severe crisis  posing significant challenges for the provision of medical services  Unraveling the Incident The hospital was reportedly bulldozed by Israeli forces  resulting in the death of several Palestinians  This action has drawn widespread condemnation and calls for international investigations from various entities  including the Palestinian Authority  the Euro Med Human Rights Monitor  and the Council on American Islamic Relations  Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee defended the action  stating that the forces had destroyed  terrorist infrastructure  at the hospital and uncovered combat tools affiliated with Hamas  Repercussions on Healthcare With the destruction of Kamal Adwan Hospital  the already strained healthcare facilities in Gaza are now under even more pressure  The Al Shifa hospital  another central healthcare provider in the region  has also been severely affected by Israeli bombardments  leading to a critical shortage of essential resources such as drinking water and food  The hospital s operating theaters are non operational  and only a limited number of patients can receive dialysis treatment each day  End of Military Operations After nearly two weeks of siege  the Israeli army announced the cessation of military operations at the Kamal Adwan Hospital  The forces reportedly detained 90 Palestinians  accusing them of participating in an attack on the Gaza Strip border  The army s actions  including the alleged burying of victims alive in the hospital courtyard  have led to calls for an international investigation  Call for International Investigation Witnesses reported that large parts of the hospital were destroyed by the Israeli military before they withdrew  The storming of the hospital led to a massive loss of life and left patients  including children with severe burns  without access to food  drink  or medical treatment  The Israeli army s claim of finding weapons and arresting Hamas members at the facility has been vehemently denied by Hamas  The WHO has expressed profound concern about the situation  highlighting the urgent need for an international probe into the incident and the resulting humanitarian crisis \\nMedan  Indonesia   As Israeli tanks and troops laid siege to the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza last week  volunteer medical worker Fikri Rofiul Haq faced the choice of evacuating to safety or staying with his patients  Haq and fellow his Indonesian colleagues  Reza Aldilla Kurniawan and Farid Zazabil Al Ayubi  volunteers with the Jakarta based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee  MER C   opted to stay put until the Israeli military forced them to leave  he said   We were evacuated via a route used by the International Red Cross with the permission of the Israeli army  There were three evacuations on Monday  Tuesday and Wednesday  and we were evacuated last as we prioritised the wounded who were at the Indonesian Hospital   Haq told Al Jazeera  Haq said that Israeli forces deliberately destroyed the Indonesian funded hospital s only working generator by setting it on fire and killed 12 people with indiscriminate shelling of the first  second and third floors of the building   Before we were evacuated  the attacks got worse and worse  hour by hour   said Haq  who was unable to communicate for several weeks until his evacuation to Khan Younis   I saw it with my own eyes  There were three large tanks around 50 metres  54 yards  from the Indonesian Hospital building and they fired periodically at the hospital  which was devastating  Now the Indonesian Hospital has been completely taken over by the Israeli army   he said  Israeli forces  who initially gave medical staff and patients just hours to leave the hospital  have been accused of reducing one of Gaza s largest medical facilities to ruins in the days leading up to the four day truce with Hamas  which began on Friday  The Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Friday that Israeli fire in the final hours before the pause killed one woman and injured at least three other people  Al Jazeera s Osama Bin Javaid  who gained access to the facility  reported that there was a  stench of death  outside the hospital  as charred and decomposing bodies  children among them  pile up in corners   Sarbini Abdul Murad  the head of MER C in Jakarta  said the attacks on the hospital were a violation of international law and that Indonesia should do more to hold Israel to account given the country s links to the hospital  which was inaugurated in 2016 by Indonesia s then Vice President Jusuf Kalla after being funded with donations from Indonesian citizens and humanitarian organisations  However  Jakarta s leverage may be limited  Indonesia does not have diplomatic ties with Israel and the hospital is not owned by Indonesia or Indonesians since it was donated to the people of Gaza   The Indonesian Hospital was built with donations by Indonesian citizens and flies the Indonesian flag as a symbol of our friendship   Sarbini told Al Jazeera   The most we can do at MER C is represent the Indonesian people and encourage the Indonesian government and the foreign ministry to take this case to the International Criminal Court  ICC     Everyone needs to lobby the ICC  particularly the big five  the five permanent members of the UN Security Council  China  France  Russia  the United Kingdom and the United States   and call for a permanent ceasefire   he added  Sarbini said there are no plans to permanently evacuate the three Indonesian volunteers from Gaza as there is still important work for them to do in terms of providing humanitarian assistance to the wounded and displaced in Khan Younis  For now  Haq and his colleagues are taking stock of their situation as they figure out how they can best help the people of Gaza  He said they are being fed well after surviving for days on dwindling rations of food and water at the besieged Indonesian Hospital   Thank God  we have enough food here now and there are people selling supplies around the European Hospital in Khan Younis   Haq said   We are eating French fries  fried aubergines and fried peppers  Sometimes we are able to get rice with a little meat  and sometimes we eat local food like bread and hummus  \\n By Maryam Qarehgozlou A horrifying scene is unfolding

a U N  backed report published Monday  The latest findings say virtually everyone in Gaza is struggling to get enough food and that nearly a third of the population of 2 3 million people are experiencing the highest levels of catastrophic hunger  At least 27 people  mostly children  have died from malnutrition and dehydration in the north  According to the new report  the death rate is expected to accelerate and reach famine levels soon  The World Health Organization said in a statement  quote   The IPC report confirms what we  our UN partners and NGOs have been witnessing and reporting for months  When our missions reach hospitals  we meet exhausted and hungry health workers who ask us for food and water  We see patients trying to recover from life saving surgeries and losses of limbs  or sick with cancer or diabetes  mothers who have just given birth  or newborn babies  all suffering from hunger and the diseases that stalk it   end quote  This comes as the Israeli military launched another major raid on Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City Monday with Israeli forces backed by tanks and artillery surrounding the complex and troops storming into a number of buildings  The Health Ministry said about 3 000 people had been sheltering at the hospital  which is the largest hospital in Gaza  and that everyone who tries to move is targeted by sniper bullets and quadcopters  they said  Among those killed in the raid was Faiq Mabhouh  a senior office in the Gaza police who was in charge of coordinating aid distribution in the north  Meanwhile  President Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone call Monday that an invasion of Rafah would be a mistake  and called on Netanyahu to send a team of officials to Washington to discuss  an alternative approach  to targeting Hamas in Rafah without a major ground invasion  Israel has continued to bomb Rafah almost daily  prompting the Palestinian Foreign Ministry to say Israel has already begun its large scale attack on the area  The death toll in Gaza is close to 32 000  over a third of them children  while nearly 74 000 people have been injured  For more  we re joined by Dr  Mustafa Barghouti  Palestinian physician  activist  politician  He serves as general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative  He s joining us from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank  Dr  Barghouti  welcome back to Democracy Now  Let s talk about this issue of famine  doctors describing the wasting that you see  for example  at the temples of people who are dying of starvation  particularly children  Can you talk about what this means and when these officials in the U N  and other bodies talk about this  man made  disaster  DR  MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI  Well  the reality is that the whole of Gaza population  2 3 million people  are suffering from malnutrition already  That includes children  men  women  pregnant women  breastfeeding women  everybody  And that is because of the Israeli imposed siege on Gaza  which is combined with continuous bombardment that is taking away the lives of people  But it is also combined with the fact that Israel has destroyed more than 70  of people s homes  They don t have normal place to be in  They don t have normal clothes  They don t have clean water to drink  And they don t have food supplies  And this is all happening in front of the world  We re talking about famine  We re talking about hunger  And we are talking about actually 700 000 people starving now in the north of Gaza  that includes also Gaza City  of whom 350 000 are children  And that s why I think almost 30 people   30 children children have died because of starvation already  This is all happening because of the Israeli siege  because nobody in the world   not the United States  not Europe  not the international community as a whole   is capable of forcing Israel to stop this terrible crime of collective punishment against a whole population  And Israel will not change its policy and its approach without sanctions  The world should impose sanctions on Israel to force it to open the routes of supplies of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza and to accept a ceasefire  because even if supplies are there and the bombardment continues  people will survive to die  That is the reality of the situation  Today  5  of the total population of Gaza have been killed or injured  We re talking about almost 120 000 people  If that had happened in the United States of America  you would be talking about almost 12 million people killed or injured in five months of this terrible war  So that is the reality of the situation  But add to that  malnutrition causes low immunity  Lack of water causes diseases  There is an outbreak of certain diseases like infectious hepatitis  which has already affected 10 000 people  We have 32 medical teams from our organization  Palestinian Medical Relief Society  working in Gaza  and they report horrible reports  About 1 million people at this very moment in Gaza are sick with respiratory diseases  with gastrointestinal infections  with diarrhea  with hepatitis  And our biggest worry is the outbreak of certain infections among children because these children in Gaza have not had vaccination for more than 165 days  AMY GOODMAN  Can you talk about   I think it s the fourth raid now on Al Shifa  And they say tens of thousands of people have taken refuge there  the Israeli military and spokespeople saying they re very careful  they have highly trained forces  that they separate the civilians from the militants  and them talking about a high level Hamas official  Faiq Mabhouh  killing him  along with other fighters   Mabhouh apparently a top food   the person in charge of food distribution in the north  DR  MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI  First of all  the Israeli army is lying when they say that they differentiate between civilians and noncivilians  How can this explain the fact that more than 80  of the people who were killed are civilians  women and children mainly  How can they explain that 70  of everybody killed are children and women  They lie  And they lie around the clock  And each time  they are caught with a crime that is obvious  like shooting the people who are starving in the north  trying to get some food from humanitarian aid  and they shot them  We re talking about 400 people shot while they were trying to get some flour  These people are totally civilians  They are not armed  They re not threat to anybody  but they killed them  in addition to injuring more than 3 000 other people  So  they keep lying  and I don t believe their lies  Now  Mr  Mabhouh  who was killed  is a policeman  He is not a fighter  He s not from Qassam Brigade  He s not carrying arms to fight  He was simply organizing some supplies to get to the north  And for the first time  two days ago  13 trucks with some flour got to the north of Gaza  clearly  And this was well organized  People received their portions  There were no gangs to steal this supply  And obviously  this is something that Israelis didn t like  They didn t like that people were organized and getting some supplies after so many days of hunger  And that s why they killed Mr  Mabhouh  They want chaos in Gaza  And their goal from attacking Shifa Hospital is actually to push people from Shifa Hospital and from Gaza City to the south  again  because the ultimate goal of Israel is ethnic cleansing  And the reality is that the whole operation  military operation  to attack Rafah is already ready to be implemented  and maybe parts of it has already started to be implemented  as you mentioned  And there  why are they attacking Rafah  with 1 4 million people there  in an area that is very small  that does not exceed 25 square miles  They will cause a terrible massacre  But their real goal is to push people through the borders to Egypt  because Netanyahu did not change his original plan of ethnic cleansing  And the United States government  Mr  Biden and his administration  instead of saying to Netanyahu   You cannot have an operation in Rafah  and you have to stop this fight  and you have to accept ceasefire   instead of that  they are deciding to become part of his war cabinet  discussing the plans of how to attack Rafah rather than saying that this attack should not take place  AMY GOODMAN  National security adviser Jake Sullivan briefed reporters on this last call between Biden and Netanyahu  He laid out the concerns Biden expressed about that possible ground invasion of Rafah  JAKE SULLIVAN  First  more than a million people have taken refuge in Rafah  They went from Gaza City to Khan Younis and then to Rafah  And they have nowhere else to go  Gaza s other major cities have largely been destroyed  And Israel has not presented us or the world with a plan for how or where they would safely move those civilians  let alone feed and house them and ensure access to basic things like sanitation    But a major ground operation there would be a mistake  It would lead to more innocent civilian deaths  worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis  deepen the anarchy in Gaza and further isolate Israel internationally  AMY GOODMAN  So  if you can talk about what this team from the Israeli government is that s going to Washington  D C   to come up with a so called alternative plan   although Israel keeps insisting they don t kill Palestinian civilians  they have very targeted troops that know exactly the difference between them   and what it means to say if they attack Rafah  which  of course  every day they are doing  but a full scale ground invasion  they will establish humanitarian   what are they describing it as  Humanitarian islands for people to go to  DR  MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI  That s not true  because there is no safe place anymore in Gaza  And if there are places which will not be bombarded  as they claim  they are places without any infrastructure  without water  without electricity  without food  without medical services  without medicines  without anything  Where will people go  To talk about the possibility of such an attack that it would cause more harm is not enough  It will cause a huge massacre  the largest massacre in human history probably  at least in the modern history  We will be talking about tens of thousands of people who would be slaughtered  That is the reality  And they have no place to escape to  Israel kept saying to people   Move from this place to that place  It will be safe   And then they would bombard the safe space  So the United States should not say   I repeat  should not say   there isn t a good plan  They should say that the whole attack should not happen and that this war must stop  And when the Israelis say they differentiate  they are lying  Are the 14 000 Palestinian children who were killed military activists or militants  These are children  for God s sake  And they are not 19 or 18 years old  These are 10 years old  2 years old  1 years old  even months old  That is the reality of what s happening in Gaza  It s a massacre  It s a huge genocide that Israel is engaging in  And the United States of America does not have the guts to go to the United Nations Security Council resolution and allow the passage of a resolution demanding immediate ceasefire  That s what we need  immediate ceasefire  no attack on Rafah  and supplies immediately to the civilian population of Gaza  which is starving  AMY GOODMAN  And can you talk   DR  MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI  Any other thing   AMY GOODMAN  Can you talk   DR  MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI  Any other thing is just talk  Yeah  please  AMY GOODMAN    about the negotiations that are going on in Qatar right now  Talk about what Hamas has put forward  DR  MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI  Hamas tried  as we were   as the reports show that we have received  the reports show that Hamas tried to be flexible  They made some concessions to make it possible to reach an agreement  because they are really worried about the humanitarian situation of the people and the so many people who have been killed  But  unfortunately  Netanyahu restricted the team that went to Qatar  He restricted their authority and authorization  And in my frank opinion  I think Netanyahu is   he made all these restrictions with his team to prevent reaching an agreement and then used that failure to justify an attack on Rafah  I do not think   because Netanyahu knows if he goes into a deal with Hamas about release of some prisoners and exchange of prisoners  his coalition partners  the fascists  Ben Gvir and Smotrich  will bring his government down  So  all he thinks about is how to save himself  how to save his position  He doesn t care about Israeli prisoners  He knows  He knows very well that if he attacks Rafah  so many Israeli prisoners will be killed  He knows that  but he doesn t care about them  And he is stuck with these fascists in his government  and he s driving his whole government into the direction   and  actually  the Israeli society at large  he s driving them into the direction of fascism  because what s happening in Palestine cannot be made except by people who have no respect whatsoever  not only to international law  but to human lives  in general  AMY GOODMAN  You re in the occupied West Bank  Dr  Mustafa Barghouti  You re in Ramallah  Can you talk about the arrest of journalists  You have Ismail al Ghoul   he s with Al Jazeera Arabic   stripped naked there for hours  detained  interrogated with others when they raided Al Shifa Hospital  Al Jazeera reported that satellite trucks were attacked outside   that s TV satellite trucks   to restrict further images  You have in the occupied West Bank Rula Hassanein  who is a Palestinian journalist  It s unclear if she was taken from her home in Ramallah  or was it Bethlehem  at like 2 00 in the morning  has a 9 month old baby  is breastfeeding  This just happened  The attack on journalists  and what do you think is the message Israel is sending  DR  MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI  The message is that they are reoccupying all of the West Bank and all of Gaza  subjecting all Palestinian people  without exception  to terrible oppression  And as you know  Amy  since the beginning of this war  Israel did not allow any foreign journalists to enter Gaza  except for one from CNN who was allowed there only for three hours  They didn t allow any foreign journalists in  and then they started executing the local journalists  Up to now  146 Palestinian journalists in Gaza were killed by Israeli snipers or Israeli bombardment  including two from Al Jazeera network  And now they ve arrested a third one  al Ghoul  and practically tortured him before releasing him  And you remember the story of the family of Dahdouh  who lost his wife  his children  because he was reporting for Al Jazeera  And in my opinion  the attacks on journalists are also taking place in the West Bank  More than 30 journalists were arrested so far  And it goes on  And in the West Bank  by the way  Israel has arrested more than 7 500 new people  The total number of people in Israeli jails in the West Bank has risen from 5 300 to almost 9 000  And one thing that the world doesn t talk about is the terrible torture that the people in Israeli prisons are subjected to  They are fighting them  torturing them with hunger  They brought down the rations for   their food rations by 70   They beat them regularly  Most recently  they attacked even one of the political prisoners  Marwan Barghouti  and many of his colleagues  as well  beating them badly  And it goes on  We have lost already 13 people in Israeli jails because of torture and because of beating and because of starvation  The situation in Israeli prisons is horrifying  And in Gaza  we don t know exactly the number of people who were imprisoned or kidnapped  We re talking about thousands of people  maybe 3 000  maybe 4 000  But the people who were released told us horrible stories about how they were tortured in an Israeli concentration camp in the Negev with electrical shocks  with drowning them in the water  with terrible beating  The director of Shifa Hospital is still in prison  They broke both of his hands  as was reported  And they tried to force him to admit things that he never did  That is the reality and the situation on the ground  It s horrifying  AMY GOODMAN  Dr  Mustafa Barghouti  I want to thank you for being with us  Palestinian physician  activist  politician  serves as general secretary of

the United States  Israel undertook this step during a visit by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan to the occupied Jerusalem  who pressed officials to reopen the crossing  Before the war  the Karm Abu Salem crossing  located in the southern corner of Gaza  at its border with Israel and Egypt  had been the primary commercial route for goods entering and exiting Gaza  On Tuesday  Egypt

international community to pressure Israel to keep the Rafah border crossing to Gaza open permanently to deliver aid to the strip  International aid organizations say Gaza needs hundreds of

for a truce is easy  The details will be the tough part  in The Sunday Times in the UK and Welt am Sonntag in Germany  calling for a  sustainable  ceasefire  saying the goal must be peace lasting  generations   The article reads   Our goal cannot simply be an end to fighting today  It must be peace lasting for days  years  and generations  We therefore support a ceasefire  but only if it is sustainable    We know many in the region and beyond have been calling for an immediate ceasefire  We recognise what motivates these heartfelt calls    It is an understandable reaction to such intense suffering  and we share the view that this conflict cannot drag on and on  That is why we supported the recent humanitarian pauses   The article marked a significant shift in tone for the two European powers toward the Israeli war on Gaza  In the early days of the conflict  both the UK and German prime ministers visited Tel Aviv to demonstrate unconditional solidarity with Israel in its announced war objectives against Hamas  Building on this stance  in the following weeks  both London and Berlin vehemently opposed all calls for an immediate ceasefire in the war  However  in recent weeks  both the UK and German governments have come under increasing domestic pressure to withdraw their support for the Israel war on Gaza  In the UK  hundreds of thousands have been joining mass weekly protests

Nations  humanitarian agency OCHA said late on Thursday that only 14 of the 36 hospitals in the Gaza Strip were functioning in any capacity  War erupted in Gaza after Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on October 7  killing about 1 200 people and taking hostages  138 of whom remain captive  according to Israeli figures  Israel s retaliatory air and ground assault on Gaza has killed 17 177 people  mostly women and children  according to the Hamas run health ministry in the besieged Palestinian territory  Weeks of fighting have reduced vast areas of Gaza to wasteland  The UN says about 80 percent of the population has been displaced  facing shortages of food  fuel  water and medicine  along with the threat of disease   Children and people begging and crying for water    we re at that level  where the most normal and basic supplies are not available any more   Lindmeier said   Right now the calculation for Gaza is one to two litres of fresh water a day    that s water for everything  not only for drinking   People are starting to cut down telephone poles to have a little bit of firewood to keep warm or maybe cook  if they have anything available   Civilisation is about to break down   Lindmeier said a convoy was supposed to take medical supplies to Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City on Friday and evacuate 12 patients to the south   That mission  we were told this morning  had to be suspended because of the security situation   he said  Health workers in the Gaza Strip do not have enough food and water to continue working  he said   Patients are bleeding on the floor  trauma wards resemble battlefields   said Lindmeier   This callousness must end  We need a ceasefire and we need it now   rjm gil\\nCasualties are rising in Gaza amid intense bombardment by the Israeli military  The temporary cease fire between Hamas and Israel ended early Friday  and Israel has resumed its bombardment of Gaza  The end of the cease fire came after Hamas freed over 100 of the more than 200 people its militants took hostage during the Oct  7 surprise attack on Israel  In exchange  Israel released more than 200 Palestinians from Israeli prisons  Click here for updates from previous days \\nGaza Hospital Attack  A Harrowing Indicator of a Deeper Crisis In an urgent declaration  the Ministry of Health in Gaza announced the tragic death of a woman in the hospital  already injured and amidst treatment  due to a sudden attack  Simultaneously  three other individuals sustained injuries in what is being referred to as an act of targeted violence  The report fell short of specific details concerning who was responsible for the attack and its exact location  Amidst Shattered Peace The incident is a stark reminder of the perpetual violence and tensions that plague the region  Civilian casualties have become a distressing norm  and infrastructure  including medical facilities  often bear the brunt of these violent outbursts  The Ministry of Health s statement underscores the profound impact these incidents have on healthcare services  exacerbating the challenges faced by medical professionals striving to provide treatment amidst conflict  Humanitarian Crisis Deepens The war between Israel and Hamas has led to widespread civilian casualties  including the deaths of many Palestinian families  A staggering 6 747 Palestinians were reported to have been killed in the first 19 days of the war alone  The escalating violence in northern Gaza s Jabalia refugee camp has claimed at least 90 lives and injured more than 100  Desperate for survival  people scramble for food and water  grabbing aid from trucks in sheer desperation  Displacement is another critical issue  with the United Nations estimating that approximately 80 percent of Gaza s population  or 1 9 million people  have been affected by the war  Underground Warfare The discovery of a large tunnel shaft in Gaza close to the Erez crossing  used by Hamas militants in a deadly attack  has further complicated the situation  Spanning over 2 5 miles long and wide enough for cars to pass through  the tunnel facilitated the transit of militants and supplies  Israel s failure to detect the attack in advance has drawn severe criticism from both military intelligence and political officials  The destruction of the Hamas tunnel network remains a top priority for Israel  who have discovered at least two other tunnels of a similar scope  A Ray of Hope Despite the grim circumstances  a glimmer of hope emerged as 201 aid trucks entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel  This marked the first time aid was allowed through since the border s closure on October 7 following Hamas attacks  Yet  the volume of aid trickling into Gaza is less than half of pre war levels  reflecting the enormity of the humanitarian crisis in the region  The ongoing conflict in Gaza continues to claim lives and disrupt the very fabric of society  As the world watches  the call for peace grows louder  underscoring the urgency of resolving longstanding tensions and fostering a climate of understanding and cooperation \\nUnderworld don Dawood Ibrahim has reportedly

deadliest Gaza war began with unprecedented attacks by Hamas  resulting in over 18 800 deaths  primarily women and children  The conflict has displaced most of Gaza s population  leading to shortages of essentials such as fuel  food  water  and medicine  Violations of International Norms and Laws The international community has established norms and laws  like the Geneva Conventions  to safeguard medical facilities and personnel during times of war  However  the storming and bombing of hospitals in Gaza by Israeli forces  leading to civilian casualty  are clear violations of these norms  The World Health Organization raised concerns over Israel s destruction of Kamal Adwan Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip  leading to the death of at least eight patients and detention of health workers

to being fed near starvation diets  and many showed signs of muscular atrophy   Some needed help just to get up from a chair   Harlev said  Even when they were given food  the children barely touched

most difficult to heal  At first  the children would only speak in whispers  if at all   More than anything  they all learned that they had to be quiet all the time  They could not laugh  or cry  or

people seeking refuge in shelters and tent camps  These individuals are grappling with severe shortages of food  medicine  and other essential supplies  A World Health Organization official who visited two hospitals in northern Gaza reported an alarming increase in amputations due to the extreme scarcity of staff  electricity  and other critical resources  In response to the escalating crisis  the UN Security Council has scheduled a long delayed vote on a new resolution aimed at halting the fighting and facilitating an increase in humanitarian aid deliveries  However  a territory wide communications outage has hindered efforts to confirm precise details regarding the ongoing conflict  Israeli Troops Kill 16 Year Old Boy in West Bank Amidst the ongoing conflict in Gaza  tensions have also flared in the occupied West Bank  The Palestinian Health Ministry reported the fatal shooting of a 16 year old boy  Mahmoud Zaoul  by Israeli forces during unrest in the village of Hussan near Bethlehem  According to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa  Zaoul was shot in the neck on Wednesday  The Israeli army claims that its troops opened fire in response to a crowd of Palestinians throwing firebombs and stones at them and is currently reviewing the incident  Since the commencement of the Israel Hamas war on October 7  over 270 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank  as per the Palestinian Health Ministry  UN Report Reveals Widespread Starvation in Gaza A joint report by UN agencies and NGOs has unveiled a shocking revelation  nearly 577 000 people in Gaza  constituting a quarter of the population  are currently facing starvation  This alarming situation has arisen due to the woefully inadequate quantities of food entering the territory since the outbreak of hostilities on October 7  Arif Husain  the chief economist of the World Food Programme  emphasized the severity of the crisis  stating that half a million people in Gaza are starving  with one in every four individuals affected  He warned that if the conflict persists at its current intensity and food deliveries remain disrupted  the population could face a full fledged famine within the next six months  accompanied by widespread disease outbreaks  The report  released by 23 UN and non governmental agencies  further highlights that the entire population of 2 2 million Gazans is experiencing a food crisis or worse  Approximately 478 000 individuals are at crisis levels  1 17 million are at emergency levels  and a staggering 576 600 are at catastrophic starvation levels   It doesn t get any worse   Husain remarked  expressing his shock at the unprecedented scale and speed of the crisis in Gaza  Makeshift Soup Kitchen Provides Meals to Hungry Palestinians In the face of severe food shortages  hundreds of displaced Palestinians in the southern Gaza Strip have turned to a makeshift soup kitchen for sustenance  Every day  they gather with pots  pans  and plastic buckets  eagerly awaiting their share of food from the large vats hanging over simple wood fires  Aya Barbakh  a woman displaced by the conflict  shared her daily routine of visiting the soup kitchen  Hungry children  parents  and older adults patiently wait their turn  some attempting to catch the attention of the attendants distributing the steaming portions  The United Nations humanitarian affairs office  OCHA  reported that half of Gaza s population is experiencing extreme or severe hunger  with 90  regularly going without food for an entire day  Mahmoud al Qishawi  an employee at the soup kitchen  described the challenges of obtaining cooking gas and their reliance on scavenging the streets of Gaza for wood to fuel the fires  With only one border crossing open into Gaza  access to food has become a critical issue in the besieged territory  Human Rights Watch  a New York based rights organization  has accused Israel of deliberately starving Gaza s population  labeling it a war crime  The Israeli military  however  has placed the blame on Hamas  alleging that the militants are stealing the aid  OCHA reported that only 10  of the food required for the territory s 2 2 million people has entered Gaza in the last 70 days  Hamas Rockets Target Tel Aviv Amidst the ongoing conflict  Hamas has launched another barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv  triggering air raid sirens in central Israel  While there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from Thursday s attack  it serves as a reminder of the militant group s resilience despite Israel s extensive air and ground campaign in Gaza  Israel continued to carry out strikes and operations across Gaza  but the widespread communications outage hindered efforts to obtain precise details about the fighting  The offensive has caused significant devastation in northern Gaza  resulting in the deaths of nearly 20 000 Palestinians and the displacement of approximately 1 9 million people  representing nearly 85  of the Palestinian territory s population  The widespread destruction and high civilian death toll have drawn international calls for a cease fire  while Israel remains committed to continuing the fight until Hamas is eliminated  The conflict was ignited by Hamas s attack into southern Israel on October 7  during which Palestinian militants killed approximately 1 200 people  primarily civilians  and abducted around 240 individuals \\nA drone crashed overnight Thursday in the Egyptian Red Sea town of Taba  near the border with Israel  Egypt s army spokesperson confirmed that the unidentified drone crashed near a

and exiting Gaza  On Tuesday  Egypt announced that it will start using the Karm Abu Salem border crossing for processing aid into the strip under an agreement with Israel  Since the start of the war  Egypt has called on the international community to pressure Israel to keep the Rafah border crossing to Gaza open permanently to deliver aid to the strip  International aid organizations say Gaza

Cameron and German counterpart Annalena Baerbock on Saturday said the  need is urgent  for a  sustainable ceasefire  in Gaza  The two ministers have published a joint article under the title  Calling for a truce is easy  The details will be the tough part  in The Sunday Times in the UK and Welt am Sonntag in Germany  calling for a  sustainable  ceasefire  saying the goal must be peace lasting  generations   The article reads   Our goal cannot simply be an end to fighting today  It must be peace lasting for days  years  and generations  We therefore support a ceasefire  but only if it is sustainable    We know many in the region and beyond have been calling for an immediate ceasefire  We recognise what motivates these heartfelt calls    It is an understandable reaction to such intense suffering  and we share the view that this conflict cannot drag on and on  That is why we supported the recent humanitarian pauses   The article marked a significant shift in tone for the two European powers toward the Israeli war on Gaza  In the early days of the conflict  both the UK and German prime ministers visited Tel Aviv to demonstrate unconditional solidarity with Israel in its announced war objectives against Hamas  Building on this stance  in the following weeks  both London and Berlin vehemently opposed all calls for an immediate ceasefire in the war  However  in recent weeks  both the UK and German governments have come under increasing domestic pressure to withdraw their support for the Israel war on Gaza  In the UK  hundreds of thousands have been joining mass weekly protests in London and other major cities demanding 10 Downing Street call for an immediate ceasefire  In Germany  thousands have defied a ban on pro Palestinian protests  joining demonstrations across the

health system in Gaza faces a catastrophic collapse as Israel Defense Forces  IDF  continue to bombard the enclave and lay siege to at least one remaining hospital in northern Gaza where patients and staff are threatened with starvation  according to aid groups and eyewitnesses  Meanwhile  airstrikes on the southern city of Khan Yunis are forcing large numbers of already displaced civilians further south to the Rafah border crossing  where medical services are scant  people are without food and sleeping on the streets  and respiratory illnesses and other diseases are running rampant  Health workers report desperate conditions across the Gaza Strip and allege that IDF warplanes are deliberately targeting civilians  Some are even warning that IDF snipers are shooting to kill anyone  including doctors and patients  who attempt to enter or flee the besieged al Awda Hospital in northern Gaza   or even get too close to a window  The aid group Doctors Without Borders said on Tuesday that one if its surgeons was injured by a  shot fired from outside the facility  and it was not the first report of Israeli snipers targeting people inside   We are at al Awda Hospital in the northern area  and have been under siege for four days  No one can move or enter or leave the hospital   said an al Awda Hospital staffer named Mohammed in a voicemail recorded over the weekend   The sniper killed our colleague when he  was standing by  the window at the 4th floor   Mohammed  who asked that only his first name be used to protect his family s safety  left a series of voicemails with news outlets and aid negotiators over the weekend that were shared with Truthout by the pro peace American Friends Service Committee  AFSC   An international aid negotiator in Jordan confirmed Mohammed s identity  The al Awda Hospital  one of the only remaining medical facilities in northern Gaza  has been under siege by Israeli forces since last week  Mohammed said about 250 patients and personnel are about to run out of food and clean water after airstrikes destroyed the facility s water tanks  Doctors are running out of medical supplies and unable to bring in more medication without risking exposure to a sniper attack  Mohammed said people at the hospital are essentially held hostage and being starved out of the facility  with patients and staff only eating one meal of rice or bread a day  According to voice messages from Mohammed  Israeli snipers targeted a pregnant woman who was attempting to enter the al Awda maternity ward with a family member last week  This message has been lightly edited for clarity  The first day of siege the sniper shot two women 70 meters away from the hospital who were coming to have maternity services for one of them  The pregnant woman could run and arrive to the hospital and had the baby  but the second one  her sister in law  was killed in the street  she is still out there   no one can bring her in  The same day  the sniper shot the son of our colleague when he was coming to the hospital  but we succeeded to save his life  After previously bombing and laying siege to other hospitals in Gaza  the IDF conducted raids in what it said were searches for Hamas militants and left the facilities destroyed  The fate of al Awda hospital remains unclear  and an AFSC aid negotiator told Truthout that the IDF has so far refused to allow aid organizations access to the clinic  Since the deadly October 7 Hamas attack on communities in southern Israel sparked the unprecedented Israeli retaliation  the IDF campaign has left at least 17 700 Palestinians dead  46 000 injured and 1 9 million people displaced from their homes  Thousands more are missing and believed to be dead under the rubble of destroyed homes and shelters  UNRWA  the United Nations refugee authority  recently confirmed that 133 employees have been killed as UN officials and aid groups beg both sides to allow more aid into Gaza  Doctors are running out of medical supplies and unable to bring in more medication without risking exposure to a sniper attack   The situation of civilians in Gaza is untenable  we are reaching a point of no return   UNRWA said on social media on Saturday  Palestinians and aid officials fear that reaching the  point of no return  will include the mass expulsion of residents from Gaza  where entire neighborhoods are now destroyed   The decimation of northern Gaza and the displacement of millions of Gazans to the south is the first stage of such a scenario  and it is already complete   UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini wrote in the Los Angeles Times   The next stage is underway   forcing people out of the urban center in Khan Yunis and closer to the Egyptian border   Israel has rejected claims that the IDF is trying to force Palestinians from Gaza  but civilians say nowhere is safe and they are running out of options  Reem Zidiah  a 22 year old student  was first displaced when the IDF targeted and destroyed her family s apartment building in Gaza City with some families still inside  She fled south with her family to a small apartment packed with dozens of family members in Khan Yunis  but over the weekend  the IDF left phone messages overnight warning her family to leave once again   We were displaced for a third time  I m now 10 minutes away from the Egyptian border   Zidiah told Truthout in a text message  Like thousands of others  Zidiah is now in Rafah  the last stop before a border crossing with Egypt that remains closed to most civilians  She shared a video of families living in tents and makeshift shelters in an overcrowded area where people are falling ill in the winter weather   Being displaced is awful in itself  what about being displaced three times  warning us to run from one place to another like animals   as Israeli officers called us   human animals    Zidiah said   I just look at the pictures of my life before the aggression and feel like it s a lie or a bad joke  all my friends  my house are just gone   Reem Zidiah took this video of a makeshift camp in southern Gaza after her family was displaced first from Gaza City and then Khan Yunis  On December 9  the aid group Doctors Without Borders began supporting the Al Shaboura clinic in Rafah and immediately treated 130 patients in a single day   Every other patient in the clinic has a respiratory tract infection due to prolonged exposure to cold and rain   said Nicholas Papachrysostomou  an emergency coordinator with Doctors Without Borders  in a statement   People are living in extremely poor hygiene conditions  In some shelters  600 people share a single toilet  We are already seeing many cases of diarrhea  Often children are the worst affected   Like many others  Zidiah is now suffering from the flu and a cough  but she said pharmacies are closed  and thousands of people are waiting in line for the only medical help available   It s not enough that we don t feel safe even in the  safe areas  they are promoting   Zidiah said   No food  no water available  and now diseases spread due to bad weather and overcrowding in the south   This story has been updated  We need

AK 47s  RPGs  explosive devices  military equipment for the Hamas elite Nukhba brigade  technological equipment  and Hamas intelligence documents  including in the NICU  During their activity at Kamal Adwan Hospital  IDF and Shin Bet forces questioned the hospital workers  who confessed that weapons were hidden in incubators in the NICU  the same incubators that were supposed to be used to treat premature babies  After questioning the hospital workers  IDF troops located weapons  classified documents  and tactical communications equipment  but no babies  By the time the IDF wrapped up its activity in the area  90 terrorists were arrested and in custody   including some who participated in the horrific October 7th massacre in southern Israel   and numerous weapons were found as well

Hospital  medical centre or Hamas headquarters  Read on for article While the Al Ahli Hospital in northern Gaza has been the epicentre of international attention  another hospital in the Strip will likely be in the headlines after a widely expected Israeli ground invasion begins  Shifa Hospital  located in the North Rimal neighbourhood and boasting 570 beds  is Gaza s largest medical centre  serving the medical needs of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians  But as Gazans are already aware  Hamas makes extensive use of the hospital too  Knowing that Israel would not dare attack a hospital during a war  Hamas leaders hide there  launch rockets from its compound  hide hostages in the bowels of the building  torture collaborators  and dig tunnels connecting Shifa to nearby sites  As far back as 2009  the Israeli Security Agency  Shin Bet  reported during the Gaza war of that year that Hamas operatives were hiding in the hospital  and that the basement had become Hamas s headquarters  But it was during the Gaza war of 2014 that Hamas activities in Shifa became too pervasive to miss  Foreign media reported that Hamas located its main offices inside Shifa Hospital and some journalists recounted seeing senior Hamas officials in its corridors  Abdel Bari Atwan  a prominent Arab editor said he even saw rocket launches from the hospital compound with his own eyes  After the war  one Hamas operative captured by the Shin Bet confirmed that leaders of the terror group hid in the hospital during all the days of fighting  And an Amnesty International report on the war released in 2015 accused Hamas of using a disused outpatient clinic to interrogate and torture suspected collaborators  Three Palestinians died in custody  Amnesty reported  Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was reportedly kept in a booby trapped tunnel shaft below the hospital for periods of his five year captivity  and it is likely that at least some of the 203 hostages taken by Hamas are there too  Shifa was originally built by British authorities in 1946  In the 1980s  Israel renovated and expanded the hospital as part of an initiative to improve Gaza living conditions  A source in Gaza told the Tazpit Press Service that during periods of heightened security tensions  portions of Shifa Hospital are routinely sealed off to the public  This restricts access for Gaza residents to various buildings and structures adjacent to the hospital  Additionally  senior Hamas officials are known to receive medical treatment there  especially during military operations  In recent days  the Israeli Defense Forces have bombed and demolished several buildings close to Shifa Hospital  A Palestinian source in Gaza told the Tazpit Press Service that those buildings are well known Hamas sites widely believed to be connected to Shifa by underground tunnels  One of the buildings   just 60 meters from Shifa   was used to produce and repair weapons  including rockets  Israeli security officials said several years ago  Placing weapons caches  command and control centres  tunnel shafts  rocket launchers and other military infrastructure in close proximity to private homes  schools  hospitals  mosques and civilian areas violates international humanitarian law  Israeli leaders insist they will eliminate Hamas from Gaza  How the military deals with the Shifa Hospital remains to be seen \\nTruce talks in Qatar also appeared to have ground to a deadlock for now Street battles raged Thursday near a hospital in besieged Gaza  where the dire humanitarian crisis and surging death count have caused tensions between Israel and top ally the United States  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to be trying to soothe a rift with US President Joe Biden with plans to send a government delegation to Washington after earlier cancelling the trip   The prime minister s office has said they d like to reschedule the meeting   said a US senior administration official  speaking on condition of anonymity and adding that they were setting a new date  Tensions flared after Washington on Monday allowed the UN Security Council to pass its first ever resolution calling for an  immediate ceasefire  and hostage release in Gaza by abstaining from the vote  Netanyahu charged that the step by the United States  which had vetoed previous similar demands  served to embolden Israel s enemy Hamas whose October 7 attack sparked the deadliest ever Gaza war  As truce talks in Qatar also appeared to have ground to a deadlock for now  heavy fighting and sustained bombardment again rocked Gaza in the nearly six month old war  The army reported heavy fighting near the Al Amal Hospital in Gaza s main southern city of Khan Yunis in which its troops had killed dozens of militants and recovered hundreds of weapons  Across Gaza  Israel s military said it had struck dozens of targets over the previous day while the health ministry in the Hamas run territory reported 62 more deaths   Decomposing bodies  Israel says Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives have fought from inside Gaza hospitals  using patients  medical staff and displaced people for cover    charges the Palestinian groups have denied  Israel said its soldiers near Al Amal had launched  targeted raids on terrorist infrastructure     and are eliminating dozens of terrorists using precise fire in close quarters combat and with air support   They had also  apprehended dozens of terrorists in the area who were transferred for interrogations   the army added  Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles have also massed around another Khan Yunis health facility  the Nasser Hospital  but had not yet staged a full scale raid  the Gaza health ministry said  Fighting has also rocked the Gaza City district around Al Shifa Hospital  the territory s biggest  where the army says it has killed around 200 militants since early last week  Local resident Karam Ayman Hathat  57  said that during the battles  explosions caused the building to shake  and that he had witnessed Israeli troops arrest several men   Israeli forces forced the men to strip down to their underwear   he said   I saw others blindfolded and ordered to follow a tank amid explosions around them   Another man from the neighbourhood  Abed Radwan  63  said he had to flee when  Israeli forces stormed all buildings and homes in the Al Rimal area  arrested several people  and forced the rest to walk south    I walked with them   he said   I saw many decomposing bodies in the streets and several houses flattened  They left nothing intact  they destroyed everything   Famine  ever closer  The war began with Hamas s October 7 attack that resulted in about 1 160 deaths in Israel  mostly civilians  according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures  The militants also took about 250 hostages  Israel says about 130 captives remain in Gaza  including 34 presumed dead  Israel s retaliatory campaign has killed at least 32 552 people  mostly women and children  according to the health ministry in Hamas run Gaza  While the war has turned much of the territory into a devastated wasteland of collapsed buildings and tank tracks  Israel has also imposed a siege on its 2 4 million people  eased only by occasional aid deliveries  The United Nations has warned that famine  is ever closer to becoming a reality in northern Gaza   and said Gaza s health system is collapsing  due to ongoing hostilities and access constraints   With clean water also scarce  Gazans were queueing to fill plastic containers from a

was unable to independently confirm the location of one   the Palestinian Medical Relief Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled  The map shows the extent of damage to neighbourhoods where the hospitals are located  In multiple instances investigated by the Guardian  the evidence indicated that Israeli munitions had hit facilities  In other instances it was not possible to attribute responsibility  Israel has repeatedly said Hamas operates within and beneath hospitals  In the case of at least two of the hospitals studied   al Shifa and al Rantisi   Israel has accused Hamas of using the basements as command centres  It also points to evacuation routes it says civilians can use to leave areas under attack  Under international humanitarian law  schools and hospitals are protected civilian objects  and the humanitarian principles of distinction and proportionality must be taken into consideration during targeting  Analysis of the imagery found damage to ambulances near five hospitals  It also found that civilians were sheltering in four of Gaza s biggest hospitals   al Quds  al Rantisi  Indonesian and al Shifa   when the damage occurred  The IDF issued multiple orders to hospitals to evacuate  In some instances  video footage suggests that the intense bombardment around facilities made it unsafe for people to leave  The World Health Organization has said evacuation of some hospitals was  impossible to carry out   Visual evidence shows Israeli tanks at various points in the area around three hospitals  An IDF spokesperson told the Guardian   The IDF has repeatedly and specifically warned these medical facilities to cease all military activity in accordance with international law  Regrettably  Hamas s systematic use of vital and sensitive civilian infrastructure such as hospitals is part of their continued and well documented tactics of using their people as human shields   Combat against a terrorist organisation that places itself near hospitals is complicated and may involve incidental hits of the facility although it was not targeted itself and without any intention to harm it   Since 7 October  when Hamas killed 1 200 people and seized an estimated 240 hostages in an unprecedented attack on Israel  Israel s bombardment of the Gaza Strip has killed more than 15 000 people  The photos and videos below detail some of the damage to healthcare facilities in the time period studied  Note  the explosion on 17 October at al Ahli hospital that caused heavy casualties and has been attributed to a misfired Palestinian rocket fell

officials have said Hamas would move its fighters unarmed in such instances  10 November Visual evidence shows the hospital being hit three times  On two occasions  fragments recovered after the hits appear to be from Israeli munitions  In the early hours of the morning  while civilians were sheltering in the hospital compound  a video seems to show a civilian injured by a munition fragment  The IDF said a  misfired projectile  launched by Hamas was responsible  Photos and videos of fragments found on the ground appear to indicate an Israeli 105mm artillery illumination flare round  which Garlasco said would have been used to aid visibility on a dark night  Video shows moment munition hits road in al Shifa hospital compound Video  Ahmed Hijazi   Saleh Aljafarawi In a separate incident

youngsters are weak  but it is their psychological scars that will be hardest to heal The children released from Hamas captivity during last month s cease fire may have appeared at first glimpse to be relatively unharmed  but  they looked like shadows of children  and are suffering psychological scars that will be difficult to heal  Dr  Efrat Harlev  CEO of Israel s Schneider Children s Medical Center  told a news conference at the Israeli government s media headquarters in Tel Aviv on Monday  Schneider  Israel s main children s hospital  cared for 19 children ages 3 to 18  six mothers  and one grandmother who had been abducted by Hamas terrorists during their murderous rampage on Oct  7 and spent nearly two months as hostages in the Gaza Strip  Harlev said all the children had lost 15  or more of their weight in captivity due to being fed near starvation diets  and many showed signs of muscular atrophy   Some needed help just to get up from a chair   Harlev said  Even when they were given food  the children barely touched it   They were eating such small bites   Harlev said   And when their parents asked   Why aren t you eating   they said   We have to save it for later    She said the psychological scars will be the most difficult to heal  At first  the children would only speak in whispers  if at all  These children were not  left unharmed as  innocent bystanders  They were deliberately hurt by Hamas  This is not a  legitimate act of  war  This was a crime   More than anything  they all learned that they had to be quiet all the time  They could not laugh  or cry  or speak   Harlev said  They would also fearfully ask permission for everything  from taking a shower to going to the bathroom to looking out the window or even opening a drawer  Hamas tormented them psychologically every day  Harlev said   We heard it from every one of them  that they did not believe they would survive  or that anyone was looking for them   that there was no Israel anymore to even return to  and that they would all die in the tunnels together   she said  Even now that they are home  it will take time for the children to believe that they are safe  Harlev said   These

Hamas which saw about 1 140 people killed  mostly civilians  and 240 hostages taken  Israel s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed 18 800 people  mostly women and children  Tel Aviv has long accused Hamas of running command centres below hospitals despite repeated denials from hospital officials and Hamas itself  In the northern region of Gaza Strip  only Al Ahli Arab hospital is  partially functioning   while three facilities  Al Shifa  Al Awda and Al Sahaba Medical Complex  are functioning at a minimum  Before the war  there were 24 operational facilities  it was reported \\nIt seems like a lifetime ago that attacking a hospital was a scandal  After Gaza s al Ahli hospital was hit by a mysterious blast on October 17  killing numerous civilians  the Israeli government resorted to desperate efforts to deny responsibility for the attack and instead blame Hamas  A deliberate military attack on a hospital is as clear a war crime as they come  and Israeli officials seemed to understand that were they pinned for the blame  it would be devastating to Israel s international standing and further turn global sentiment against its military campaign   Several independent reports since have lent credence to Israeli claims that the culprit may have been a misfired Hamas rocket   Fast forward a month and a half  and Israeli forces have now attacked and shut down Gaza s largest hospital  bombed a convoy of ambulances  and besieged and bombed Indonesian Hospital  just a few cases out of the more than two dozen Gazan hospitals that Israeli attacks have rendered nonfunctional  All of it has been done out in the open and  more often than not  alongside public justifications for the attacks   with devastating consequences for those trapped inside  and with a modicum of the outcry that once greeted al Ahli s bombing  This  unrelenting war  on the Gaza health sector  as one United Nations official has called it  continues as you read this  with Israeli forces turning their guns on al Awda hospital in northern Gaza to little public attention  At the time of writing  more than 240 people are trapped inside al Awda  the last functioning hospital in northern Gaza providing maternity services  and currently in the ninth day of a siege that s left several people dead and those inside struggling to survive  The increasingly dire situation has been provided to media in daily updates by Mohammed Salha  a monitoring manager at the hospital who has described to Jacobin the desperate conditions faced by the patients  medical staff  and families who have no way out of the facility  Al Awda is surrounded by snipers  according to Salha  making it impossible to move between hospital buildings  and leaving survivors corralled in a single building  sleeping far from windows and crawling on the floor to avoid being shot  Snipers have already killed two of Salha s colleagues and a janitor who came too close to the windows  as well as a relative of a pregnant patient  who was shot in the street outside the hospital and whose body has been left to decompose  unable to be retrieved by those inside  Another  a sixteen year old  was also shot outside the hospital  but had his life saved by medical personnel  As a result  hospital staff have been rationing the rapidly dwindling food  water  and medicine supplies  says Salha  with the more than two hundred people trapped in the hospital subsisting on one meal per day of bread or rice  No food  water  or fuel is coming in  while Israeli forces bombed the facility s water tanks on the fifth day of the siege  The presence of snipers means no one can leave to refill the generator powering the facility  nor travel between buildings to get more medication  putting patients under further risk   We are living in a disaster here   Salha told Jacobin  Those patients include children and babies  On the eighth day of the siege  Salha says  medical staff had to amputate the leg of a four year old girl  risking infection  A video provided to Jacobin shows several sickly  ashen faced young children sleeping in a hospital corridor  According to Salha  no warning from Israeli forces preceded the siege and there has been no communication from Israeli forces as it s gone on  while no one can leave the grounds for fear of being killed by snipers  making it impossible to know what the military goal of the attack is or how those trapped inside might evacuate   The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment   Salha is calling for provisions of food  water  fuel  and medicine to be allowed inside the hospital and for public pressure on the Israeli government to end the siege  If not  the scene described suggest patients and staff are facing imminent starvation and dehydration  alongside medical complications from lack of medicine and unsanitary conditions  This isn t the first time the Israeli military has attacked al Awda  In late November  Médecins Sans Frontières  MSF  had two of its doctors killed when Israeli forces struck the third and fourth floors of the hospital  According to MSF  it had regularly shared with the Israeli military information about al Awda and the presence of its staff before the strike  At the start of this month  the organization blamed Israel for what it called a  deliberate attack against clearly identified MSF vehicles  that were part of an evacuation convoy  killing two family members of its staff  An MSF spokesperson described conditions in al Awda reported by colleagues in the hospital that matched Salha s account  including a  total siege  imposed by Israeli forces since December 5 and snipers surrounding the hospital targeting those inside  Five hospital staff have been killed in various attacks since October 7 according to the organization  while one MSF affiliated surgeon in the facility was injured by sniper fire on December 11   Reports coming out of al Awda hospital are harrowing and we are gravely worried for safety of patients and staff inside   said Renzo Fricke  MSF head of mission in the occupied Palestinian territories   Let us be clear  al Awda is a functioning hospital with medical staff and many patients in vulnerable condition  Targeting medical workers as they care for their patients is utterly reprehensible  utterly inhumane   Meanwhile  yesterday Israeli forces stormed Kamal Adwan Hospital  also in northern Gaza  after days of besieging and bombing it  mirroring the strategy it has taken to previous assaults on Gaza s medical facilities  and providing a possible preview of what awaits those trapped in al Awda  Previous raids on hospitals have led to civilian deaths and horrifying scenes of patients   including children and premature babies   being left behind to die and decompose by evacuating staff  Top Israeli leadership has previously strongly condemned attacks on hospitals  as when it accused Hamas of causing the explosion at al Ahli  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the alleged perpetrators  barbaric terrorists   while president Isaac Herzog said al Ahli was  a place where lives should be saved  and laid  shame on the vile terrorists in Gaza who willfully spill the blood of the innocent   The ongoing siege of al Awda is a reminder of the brutality of what has been an exceptionally savage military campaign by Israel  as well as the seemingly growing public tolerance for Israeli war crimes  Not even two months ago  the bombing of a hospital was a major outrage  now  when a public outcry is desperately needed to stop it  the siege of another hospital is just one more thread in a tapestry of violence  What crimes will become normal in another month or two \\nText size The head of the World Health Organization on Sunday denounced  the effective destruction  of the Kamal Adwan hospital in the north of Gaza  adding that at least eight patients had died  Among the deceased patients was a 9 year old child  said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a post on X  formerly Twitter  His statement came as the Israeli army pulled out of the hospital after an operation lasting several days  claiming it had been used as a command and control centre by Hamas  Hamas has repeatedly denied such claims    WHO is appalled by the effective destruction of Kamal Adwan hospital in northern  Gaza over the last several days  rendering it non functional and resulting in the death of at least 8 patients   wrote Tedros   Many health workers were reportedly detained  and WHO and partners are urgently seeking information on their status   he added  Israel s representative to the United Nations posted to X accusing Tedros of making no mention of  Hamas entrenchment in hospitals   Israel said that before entering the hospital  it had negotiated safe passage for the evacuation of most of the hospital  The statement by Tedros said   We learned that many patients had to self evacuate at great risk to their health and safety  with ambulances unable to reach the facility   Of the deceased patients  several died due to lack of adequate health care  including a 9 year old child   We are extremely concerned for the well being of the internally displaced people who are reportedly sheltering in the hospital building   All health care facilities in the Gaza Strip have been hit hard by the bombardments and ground
