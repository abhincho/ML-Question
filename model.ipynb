stopped writing on social media platforms about the Palestine crisis despite having so many thoughts in his mind He writes and deletes but does not dare to post in support of Palestine out of fear as the UP Chief Minister has directed police to take strict action against anyone attempting to make \\\"inciteful\\\" statements either on social media or from places of worship\\n\\n\\\"A few years back we saw a lockdown in the wake of COVID The government is putting a similar ban on our pens and minds We cannot write what we see with our own eyes or what we think We dont feel that we are free citizens of a free country anymore\\\" Jameel told NewsClick\\n\\nRecalling the UP Police crackdown on the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens

lives in constant fear after a constable was suspended for allegedly sharing a post supporting Palestine on social media\\n\\n\\\"I dont write anything on social media but I share videos and photos I like However videos coming from Gaza are heart-wrenching Hundreds of people died in the horrific airstrike by Israel I wanted to share those videos of how cruel Israel is taking innocent lives but due to fear of legal action I am not sharing anything In fact I stopped using the internet Our colleagues are keeping tabs on our social media and what we (Muslims) are writing/sharing on social sites\\\" he said\\n\\nSuhail Ansari a constable who was posted in the Lakhimpur Kheri district was suspended and a departmental enquiry was initiated against him for allegedly sharing posts in support of Palestine According to the police he had launched a drive on social media to collect funds to help Palestine\\n\\nAnsari a resident of Bareilly posted on his Facebook account according to the police\\n\\n\\\"Help Save Palestine I Repost=$1 All Donations Are Directly Sent To Add To Story To Help Save Palestine\\\" the post reads\\n\\nTalking to media persons Kheri deputy superintendent of

allegation of collecting funds for Palestine\\n\\n\\\"Suhail did not write anything in support of Palestine but shared a forwarded message that sharing posts will credit one dollar to Palestinians

case against an unidentified youth in Bareilly district who had posted pictures of aerial bombings on Gaza\\n\\nAdityanath has warned of strict action against anyone indulging in activities that oppose the Indian governments stand on the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and voicing support for Palestine on social media\\n\\nThe directive came close on the heels of a pro-Palestine march in support of Palestinians held in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) campus last week\\n\\nMeanwhile several Muslim youths and clerics have been detained for their posts on Palestine\\n\\nA Muslim cleric was arrested in Uttar Pradeshs Hamirpur for posting content in support of Palestine on social media The accused has been identified as 23-year-old Suhail Ansari\\n\\nThe police on Friday booked Ansari and another cleric named Atif Chowdhary under Indian Penal Code Sections 153A (promoting enmity between two groups) and 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity hatred or ill-will between classes) in the case The police are conducting raids to take Chowdhary into custody\\n\\nA doctor identified as Parmendra Maheshwari has also been booked in Bareilly for allegedly making objectionable

the university campus to express solidarity with Palestinians Aligarh police registered a case at Civil Lines police station against the four students mentioned in the first information report (FIR)\\n\\nOn October 8 approximately 100 students gathered at Duck Point in the AMU campus for the march They proceeded to march to the main gate or Bab-e-Syed gate of AMU chanting slogans in support of Palestinians and condemning Israel for its \\\"dominance and atrocities against civilians\\\"\\n\\nBoth the university and district administration said that the protest march was held without the

Nazeer a lawyer in Siddharthnagar told NewsClick \\\"When the Ministry of External Affairs supported the establishment of a sovereign independent and viable state of Palestine why is the state government taking action against its citizens The reason people are afraid of writing on social media is that police first book for post and then they call for interrogation In the name of interrogation they run from police station to court and nobody wants to run from pillar to post for merely sharing a post on social media\\\"\",\n          \"Arab nations have linked hands with the

the Iranian foreign minister said that if what he described as the genocide did not stop the US would \\u201cnot be spared from this fire\\u201d\\n\\nThe debate was occasionally unsettling for the US as diplomats from across the globe challenged what they frequently described as Washington\\u2019s unqualified support for Israel since the Hamas attack that killed 1400 people Since then according to the Palestinian authorities more than 7000 people have been killed in Gaza with Israel pounding the territory with airstrikes\\n\\nThe tone of the debate was set by its title \\u2013 Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory A large majority of nations in the assembly will probably condemn Israel if a non-binding vote is called on Friday\\n\\nThe smaller 15-strong UN security council including its five permanent veto wielding members has been unable to reach agreement on the terms of a humanitarian pause to the hostilities\\n\\nOn Wednesday Russia and the US vetoed each other\\u2019s resolutions The US last week also vetoed a Brazilian resolution calling for humanitarian corridors into Gaza on the grounds

Hamas\\n\\nThe Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour said that at least 80 Palestinian families had lost 10 or more of their relatives and sometimes up to 45 members of the same families had been killed \\u201cHow can representatives of states explain how horrible it is that 1000 Israelis were killed and not feel the same outrage when 1000 Palestinians are now killed every single

Hamas fighter trying to decapitate a man with a garden tool during the attack on 7 October this year\\n\\nErdan who has called for the resignation of the UN secretary general Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres insisted: \\u201cThis is not a war with the Palestinians Israel is at war with the genocidal Hamas terrorist organisation \\u2026 Hamas do not care about the Palestinian people Hamas has only one goal \\u2013 to annihilate Israel\\u201d\\n\\nIn a joint statement the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates Jordan Bahrain Saudi Arabia Oman Qatar Kuwait Egypt and Morocco on Thursday condemned the targeting of civilians and violations of international law in Gaza\\n\\nTheir statement said the right to self-defence did not justify breaking the law and neglecting Palestinians\\u2019 rights The Arab ministers also condemned forced displacement and collective punishment of the Palestinians in Gaza\\n\\nThey criticised Israel\\u2019s continued occupation of Palestinian areas and called for more efforts to implement a two-state solution to the decades-long conflict an idea that has been the foundation of a long-moribund peace process\\n\\n\\u201cThe absence of a political solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has led to repeated acts of violence and suffering for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and the peoples of the region\\u201d it said\\n\\nSupport for Israel came from European governments The German chancellor Olaf Scholz said EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Friday would send a clear signal of backing for Israel in what he called its self-defence efforts\\n\\nQatar also said its work trying to negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas was being hampered by the continued Israeli bombardment The Qatari foreign affairs minister Mohammed Al Khulaifi said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very very difficult negotiation \\u2026 with the bombing continuing every day our task becomes more difficult But despite that we remain hopeful we remain committed\\u201d\\n\\nAnger was also expressed at a new pitch by the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\\u011fan He said \\u201cthe Israeli attack on Gaza \\u2026 has reached the level of a massacre and the silence of the international community on what is happening is a shame for humanity\\u201d\\n\\nErdo\\u011fan added that peace would \\u201conly be possible with the creation of an independent

and another cleric named Atif Chowdhary under Indian Penal Code Sections 153A (promoting enmity between two groups) and 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity hatred or ill-will between classes) in the case The police are conducting raids to take Chowdhary into custody\\n\\nA doctor identified as Parmendra Maheshwari has also been booked in Bareilly for allegedly making objectionable

(deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) He has not been arrested yet\\n\\nResentment Over Police Crackdown on AMU Students\\n\\nThe Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) campus witnessed uneasy calm as hundreds of security personnel guarded the main gate of the varsity Throughout the day the campus streets bore silence while students completely avoided writing anything related to Palestine\\n\\nResentment is brewing among students soon after four students were booked for participating in a protest march on the university campus to express solidarity with Palestinians Aligarh police registered a case at Civil Lines police station against the four students mentioned in the first information report (FIR)\\n\\nOn October 8 approximately 100 students gathered at Duck Point in the AMU campus for the march They proceeded to march to the main gate or Bab-e-Syed gate of AMU chanting slogans in support of Palestinians and condemning Israel for its \\\"dominance and atrocities against civilians\\\"\\n\\nBoth the university and district administration said that the protest march was held without the required permission for such activities on the university campus\\n\\nAccording to the FIR (seen by NewsClick) a case has been filed under Sections 153A (promoting enmity among different groups) 188 (disobedience to orders promulgated by a public servant) and Section 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)\\n\\nCommenting over the ongoing situation Sarfraz Nazeer a lawyer in Siddharthnagar told NewsClick \\\"When the Ministry of External Affairs supported the establishment of a sovereign independent and viable state of Palestine why is the state government taking action against its citizens The reason people are afraid of writing on social media is that police first book for post and then they call for interrogation In the name of interrogation they run from police station to court and nobody wants to run from pillar to post for merely sharing a post on social media\\\"\",\n          \"Arab nations have linked hands with the Global South to challenge Israel and its western backers to end the bombing in a Gaza at the start of a rare two-day emergency debate at the UN general assembly\\n\\nIn a fierce warning on Thursday the Iranian foreign minister said that if what he described as the genocide did not stop the US would \\u201cnot be spared from this fire\\u201d\\n\\nThe debate was occasionally unsettling for the US as diplomats from across the globe challenged what they frequently described as Washington\\u2019s unqualified support for Israel since the Hamas attack that killed 1400 people Since then according to the Palestinian authorities more than 7000 people have been killed in Gaza with Israel pounding the territory with airstrikes\\n\\nThe tone of the debate was set by its title \\u2013 Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory A large majority of nations in the assembly will probably condemn Israel if a non-binding vote is called on Friday\\n\\nThe smaller 15-strong UN security council including its five permanent veto wielding members has been unable to reach agreement on the terms of a humanitarian pause to the hostilities\\n\\nOn Wednesday Russia and the US vetoed each other\\u2019s resolutions The US last week also vetoed a Brazilian resolution calling for humanitarian corridors into Gaza on the grounds that it did not assert Israel\\u2019s right to self-defence\\n\\nA resolution passed by the security council carries more weight than one passed by the larger 193-country general assembly\\n\\nIn a stark warning Iran\\u2019s foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said : \\u201cI say frankly to the American statesmen who are managing the genocide in Palestine that we do not welcome an expansion of the war in the region But if the genocide in Gaza continues they will not be spared from this fire\\u201d He insisted progress was being made to secure the release of hostages seized by Hamas\\n\\nThe Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour said that at least 80 Palestinian families had lost 10 or more of their relatives and sometimes up to 45 members of the same families had been killed \\u201cHow can representatives of states explain how horrible it is that 1000 Israelis were killed and not feel the same outrage when 1000 Palestinians are now killed every single day\\u201d Mansour asked\\n\\nAyman Hussein Abdullah Al-Safadi Jordan\\u2019s foreign minister lambasted the language used by Israel saying \\u201cthe Israeli government \\u2026 called for wiping out Palestinians of the face of this Earth called them animals unworthy of life\\u201d\\n\\nThe Israeli ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan showed the general assembly a brief video that he said showed a Hamas fighter trying to decapitate a man with a garden tool during the attack on 7 October this year\\n\\nErdan who has called for the resignation of the UN secretary general Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres insisted: \\u201cThis is not a war with the Palestinians Israel is at war with the genocidal Hamas terrorist organisation \\u2026 Hamas do not care about the Palestinian people Hamas has only one goal \\u2013 to annihilate Israel\\u201d\\n\\nIn a joint statement the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates Jordan Bahrain Saudi Arabia Oman Qatar Kuwait Egypt and Morocco on Thursday condemned the targeting of civilians and violations of international law in Gaza\\n\\nTheir statement said the right to self-defence did not justify breaking the law and neglecting Palestinians\\u2019 rights The Arab ministers also condemned forced displacement and collective punishment of the Palestinians in Gaza\\n\\nThey criticised Israel\\u2019s continued occupation of Palestinian areas and called for more efforts to implement a two-state solution to the decades-long conflict an idea that has been the foundation of a long-moribund peace process\\n\\n\\u201cThe absence of a political solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has led to repeated acts of violence and suffering for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and the peoples of the region\\u201d it said\\n\\nSupport for Israel came from European governments The German chancellor Olaf Scholz said EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Friday would send a clear signal of backing for Israel in what he called its self-defence efforts\\n\\nQatar also said its work trying to negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas was being hampered by the continued Israeli bombardment The Qatari foreign affairs minister Mohammed Al Khulaifi said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very very difficult negotiation \\u2026 with the bombing continuing every day our task becomes more difficult But despite that we remain hopeful we remain committed\\u201d\\n\\nAnger was also expressed at a new pitch by the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\\u011fan He said \\u201cthe Israeli attack on Gaza \\u2026 has reached the level of a massacre and the silence of the international community on what is happening is a shame for humanity\\u201d\\n\\nErdo\\u011fan added that peace would \\u201conly be possible with the creation of an independent sovereign and geographically integrated Palestinian state according to the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital\\u201d\",\n          \"Even as the BSE Sensex fell over 1000 points in the last four sessions US investment bank Morgan Stanley said it has increased its overweight (OW) stance on the Indian equity market terming it as its most preferred emerging market\\n\\n\\u201cRelative

changes in monetary policies have somewhat abated after September CPI moderated to 5 per cent and core CPI slowed further to 46 per cent with the team forecasting below 5 per cent in October Morgan

per cent (in USD terms) from early 2021 until October 2022 and we expect outperformance to continue with India starting to show a material breakout in relative EPS versus EM and having relatively low correlation/revenues from both the US and China\\u201d it said\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn Friday global equities fell and oil and gold prices climbed as investors responded to the threat of a weekend escalation that would spread the conflict between Israel and Hamas to the wider Middle East region The sight of US government bonds yields hitting 5 per cent for the first time since 2007 amid an increasingly threatening conflict in the Middle East left investors searching for safety\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\u201cNifty fell on October 20 showing persistent weakness However it has formed a

monetary tightening emphasized by the US Fed Chair created a layer of volatility in the market While heightened oil prices and elevated US bond yields will impact the domestic monetary environment and

like However videos coming from Gaza are heart-wrenching Hundreds of people died in the horrific airstrike by Israel I wanted to share those videos of how cruel Israel is taking innocent lives but due to fear of legal action I am not sharing anything In fact I stopped using the internet Our colleagues are keeping tabs on our social media and what we (Muslims) are writing/sharing on social sites\\\" he said\\n\\nSuhail Ansari a constable who was posted in the Lakhimpur Kheri district was suspended and a departmental enquiry was initiated against him for allegedly sharing posts in support of Palestine According to the police he had launched a drive on social media to collect funds to help Palestine\\n\\nAnsari a resident of Bareilly posted on his Facebook account according to the police\\n\\n\\\"Help Save Palestine I Repost=$1 All Donations Are Directly Sent To Add To Story To Help Save Palestine\\\" the post reads\\n\\nTalking to media persons Kheri deputy superintendent of

case against an unidentified youth in Bareilly district who had posted pictures of aerial bombings on Gaza\\n\\nAdityanath has warned of strict action against anyone indulging in activities that oppose the Indian governments stand on the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and voicing support for Palestine on social media\\n\\nThe directive came close on the heels of a pro-Palestine march in support of Palestinians held in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) campus last week\\n\\nMeanwhile several Muslim youths and clerics have been detained for their posts on Palestine\\n\\nA Muslim cleric was arrested in Uttar Pradeshs Hamirpur for posting content in support of Palestine on social media The accused has been identified as 23-year-old Suhail Ansari\\n\\nThe police on Friday booked Ansari and another cleric named Atif Chowdhary under Indian Penal Code Sections 153A (promoting enmity between two groups) and 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity hatred or ill-will between classes) in the case The police are conducting raids to take Chowdhary into custody\\n\\nA doctor identified as Parmendra Maheshwari has also been booked in Bareilly for allegedly making objectionable comments against Muslims on WhatsApp after the Israel-Hamas war broke out\\n\\nMaheshwari has been charged under Indian Penal Code Sections 153A (promoting enmity between two groups) and 295A

AMU Students\\n\\nThe Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) campus witnessed uneasy calm as hundreds of security personnel guarded the main gate of the varsity Throughout the day the campus streets bore silence while students completely avoided writing anything related to Palestine\\n\\nResentment is brewing among students soon after four students were booked for participating in a protest march on the university campus to express solidarity with Palestinians Aligarh police registered a case at Civil Lines police station against the four students mentioned in the first information report (FIR)\\n\\nOn October 8 approximately 100 students gathered at Duck Point in the AMU campus for the march They proceeded to march to the main gate or Bab-e-Syed gate of AMU chanting slogans in support of Palestinians and condemning Israel for its \\\"dominance and atrocities against civilians\\\"\\n\\nBoth the university and district administration said that the protest march was held without the required permission for such activities on the university campus\\n\\nAccording to the FIR (seen by NewsClick) a case has been filed under Sections 153A (promoting enmity among different groups) 188

Nazeer a lawyer in Siddharthnagar told NewsClick \\\"When the Ministry of External Affairs supported the establishment of a sovereign independent and viable state of Palestine why is the state government taking action against its citizens The reason people are afraid of writing on social media is that police first book for post and then they call for interrogation In the name of interrogation they run from police station to court and nobody wants to run from pillar to post for merely sharing a post on social media\\\"\",\n          \"Arab nations have linked hands with the

as diplomats from across the globe challenged what they frequently described as Washington\\u2019s unqualified support for Israel since the Hamas attack that killed 1400 people Since then according to the Palestinian authorities more than 7000 people have been killed in Gaza with Israel pounding the territory with airstrikes\\n\\nThe tone of the debate was set by its title \\u2013 Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory A large majority of nations in the assembly will probably condemn Israel if a non-binding vote is called on Friday\\n\\nThe smaller 15-strong UN security council including its five permanent veto wielding members has been unable to reach agreement on the terms of a humanitarian pause to the hostilities\\n\\nOn Wednesday Russia and the US vetoed each other\\u2019s resolutions The US last week also vetoed a Brazilian resolution calling for humanitarian corridors into Gaza on the grounds

Hamas fighter trying to decapitate a man with a garden tool during the attack on 7 October this year\\n\\nErdan who has called for the resignation of the UN secretary general Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres insisted: \\u201cThis is not a war with the Palestinians Israel is at war with the genocidal Hamas terrorist organisation \\u2026 Hamas do not care about the Palestinian people Hamas has only one goal \\u2013 to annihilate Israel\\u201d\\n\\nIn a joint statement the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates Jordan Bahrain Saudi Arabia Oman Qatar Kuwait Egypt and Morocco on Thursday condemned the targeting of civilians and violations of international law in Gaza\\n\\nTheir statement said the right to self-defence did not justify breaking the law and neglecting Palestinians\\u2019 rights The Arab ministers also condemned forced displacement and collective punishment of the Palestinians in Gaza\\n\\nThey criticised Israel\\u2019s continued occupation of Palestinian areas and called for more efforts to implement a two-state solution to the decades-long conflict an idea that has been the foundation of a long-moribund peace process\\n\\n\\u201cThe absence of a political solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has led to repeated acts of violence and suffering for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and the peoples of the region\\u201d it said\\n\\nSupport for Israel came from European governments The German chancellor Olaf Scholz said EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Friday would send a clear signal of backing for Israel in what he called its self-defence efforts\\n\\nQatar also said its work trying to negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas was being hampered by the continued Israeli bombardment The Qatari foreign affairs minister Mohammed Al Khulaifi said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very very difficult negotiation \\u2026 with the bombing continuing every day our task becomes more difficult But despite that we remain hopeful we remain committed\\u201d\\n\\nAnger was also expressed at a new pitch by the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\\u011fan He said \\u201cthe Israeli attack on Gaza \\u2026 has reached the level of a massacre and the silence of the international community on what is happening is a shame for humanity\\u201d\\n\\nErdo\\u011fan added that peace would \\u201conly be possible with the creation of an independent

changes in monetary policies have somewhat abated after September CPI moderated to 5 per cent and core CPI slowed further to 46 per cent with the team forecasting below 5 per cent in October Morgan Stanley said\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe trade deficit has also narrowed with service trade balance improving sequentially in September \\u201cIndia has been structurally outperforming MSCI EM by 455 per cent (in USD terms) from early 2021 until October 2022 and we expect outperformance to continue with India starting to show a material breakout in relative EPS versus EM and having relatively low correlation/revenues from both the US and China\\u201d it said\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn Friday global equities fell and oil and gold prices climbed as investors responded to the threat of a weekend escalation that would spread the conflict between Israel and Hamas to the wider Middle East region The sight of US government bonds yields hitting 5 per cent for the first time since 2007 amid an increasingly threatening conflict in the Middle East left investors searching for safety\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\u201cNifty fell on October 20 showing persistent weakness However it has formed a doji after a fall suggesting possibility of a bounce\\u201d said Deepak Jasani Head of Retail Research HDFC Securities\\n\\nThe BSE Sensex fell 035 per cent or 232 points to 6539762 and the NSE Nifty Index declined by 82 points to 1954265\\n\\nVinod Nair Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said \\u201cThe added uncertainty stemming from West Asia tensions and the imperative for continued monetary tightening emphasized by the US Fed Chair created a layer of volatility in the market While heightened oil prices and elevated US bond yields will impact the domestic monetary environment and operational metrics of the companies\\u201d\\n\\nFurthermore the varied results of blue-chip companies influenced by subdued global & domestic demand are steering the market towards a consolidation trajectory in the near term Nair said\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dateModified\",\n      \"properties\":
