I have done first part of the Q1 and since there is mentioned that I need to attempt any of 2 so I just did first one, and below is the explanation
of the same step by step:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
First, we load the JSON file containing the news articles. Since the data might contain special characters and extra spaces,
we need to clean it up.
2. Filtering Relevant Articles
To ensure our QA system focuses on the Israel-Hamas war, we filter out irrelevant articles. We define a list of keywords related 
to the conflict and keep only those articles that contain these keywords.
3. Load a Pre-trained QA Model
We use a pre-trained QA model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. In this case, we choose the distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad
model for its efficiency and accuracy in question answering tasks.
4. Augment Context with Wikipedia
To enhance the context available for the QA system, we fetch additional information from Wikipedia. This step helps provide a more 
comprehensive background for the QA model.
5. Combine Context
We combine the filtered articles with the Wikipedia context. This combined context is then used by the QA model to answer questions.
6. Answer Questions
Finally, we create a function that uses the combined context to answer a given question.
