The following code builds a question-answering system using LangChain, a framework to build applications with
large language models. The system has been trained on a JSON file composed of news articles and can be used to
answer queries posed within the context of the articles.

1. Importing Required Libraries:
   The notebook begins by importing the necessary libraries, which include `json`, for reading JSON files,
   `torch` and `transformers`, which are used to handle the pre-trained language model, and several modules
   from LangChain and LangChain-community, which will be used to create the question-answering system.

2. Loading and Preprocessing Data:
   The code will load the JSON file `news_article.json` and then extract the information from each article — that is,
   the title and the article itself. It creates a list of `Document` objects, where each document represents an article.

   The `chunk_text` helper function is defined in order to be able to chunk text to smaller units. This is due to the
   fact that some language models can only take in text of a certain maximum length and also it makes it easier to generate
   the embedding faster.

   The `HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings` is initialized. It transforms text into a more dense vector representation (embeddings)
   using the pre-trained language model.

3. Creating a Vector Store:
   This block of code creates a vector store using the library FAISS, which is a library for efficient similarity search 
   and vector storage. The `FAISS.from_documents` function takes in the list of `Document` objects and the embeddings model 
   (`huggingface_embeddings`) and creates a vector store. This vector store will be used for efficient retrieval of relevant 
   documents based on a given query.

4. Initializing the Language Model:
   The notebook initiates the language model, which can be used to generate answers. In this case, the `ChatGroq` model is from 
   LangChain-community, which is a wrapper around the Groq AI service. This creates an instance of the `ChatGroq` model 
   initialized with an API key and the name of the language model (`Llama3-8b-8192`).

5. Creating the Question-Answering Chain:
   The code creates a `RetrievalQA` chain, which is a combination of a retriever, the vector store being made, and a 
   language model. Here, it creates a chain by calling `RetrievalQA.from_chain_type` with the language model (`llm`), 
   the chain type (`\"stuff\"`), and the retriever (`vector_store.as_retriever()`).

6. Asking Questions and Getting Answers:
   It shows how to ask questions and get answers from the question-answering system. It prompts the user for a question, 
   runs the `qa.run` method with the question, and prints the generated answer.

   In this case, it asks the question \"What happened at the Al-Shifa Hospital?\" and receives a system-generated answer 
   from the articles provided.

   Ask the question \"Tell me something about Yemen air strikes in 2024\", and the system summarizes relevant information 
   on the US–British air strikes in Yemen and the reaction by the Yemeni armed forces.

In essence, this code has the thought process of leveraging large language model and vector embedding capabilities to create 
a question-answering system that can derive relevant information from a document corpus and generate user query natural 
language answers. LangChain, with pre-trained language models, vector stores, and combination, allows the retrieval and 
processing of information to be done more efficiently so that accurate and contextual answers are available.
