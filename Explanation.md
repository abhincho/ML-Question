# Explanation of Thought Process for the Assignment

## Introduction
The objective of this assignment is to create a rudimentary Question Answering (QA) system capable of answering questions related to the Israel-Hamas war. The solution involves several critical steps, including data loading, cleaning, filtering, model training, and answer generation. This document outlines the thought process behind each step, explaining how and why they were executed.

## Steps and Thought Process

### 1. Data Loading
**Objective:** Load the dataset of news articles into the environment.

**Thought Process:** 
The dataset, provided in JSON format, was stored on Google Drive. The first step involved accessing and loading this dataset into the environment to make it available for further processing.

### 2. Data Cleaning
**Objective:** Remove noise from the articles to improve the text quality.

**Thought Process:** 
Since the dataset was scraped from the web, it likely contained various forms of noise, such as punctuation, special characters, and irrelevant symbols. A data cleaning process was applied to normalize the text, ensuring consistency and better performance in subsequent steps.

### 3. Filtering Relevant Articles
**Objective:** Identify and retain articles that are relevant to the Israel-Hamas war.

**Thought Process:** 
Not all articles in the dataset were pertinent to the Israel-Hamas conflict. By defining a set of keywords related to the conflict, we could filter out irrelevant articles, retaining only those that contained these keywords. This step ensured that the QA system focused on relevant content.

### 4. Wikipedia Information Augmentation
**Objective:** Fetch additional information from Wikipedia to supplement the dataset.

**Thought Process:** 
While the dataset provided a substantial amount of information, it might not cover every aspect of the Israel-Hamas conflict. By augmenting the dataset with summaries from Wikipedia, we ensured that the QA system had access to comprehensive and authoritative information, filling any gaps in the dataset.

### 5. Model Initialization
**Objective:** Initialize a pre-trained Question Answering model.

**Thought Process:** 
Leveraging a pre-trained QA model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library was a strategic choice. It allowed us to build on existing, well-trained models rather than training from scratch, saving time and computational resources. This step set up a robust foundation for the QA system.

### 6. Answer Generation
**Objective:** Generate accurate answers to user questions using the QA model.

**Thought Process:** 
The QA model was used to process the filtered articles and the additional Wikipedia information. By splitting longer articles into manageable chunks, we ensured that the model could focus on relevant sections, thereby improving answer accuracy. This step involved generating, scoring, and selecting the best answers from the available content.

### 7. Interactive User Input
**Objective:** Provide an interface for users to input questions and receive answers.

**Thought Process:** 
An interactive loop was implemented to allow users to input their questions and receive answers in real-time. This made the QA system user-friendly and accessible, ensuring it could effectively serve its intended purpose.

## Conclusion
The development of this QA system involved a series of methodical steps designed to clean and filter the dataset, augment it with reliable information, and utilize a powerful pre-trained model to generate accurate answers. By carefully considering each step and its impact, we created a robust system capable of addressing complex questions about the Israel-Hamas conflict.
