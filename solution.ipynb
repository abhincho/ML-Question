      "israel launching a ground offensive in the gaza strip is a certainty but what remains to be seen is how the israeli military goes about it according to a russian analyst there are different ways that any force could employ a ground military operation taking into consideration various aspects boris dolgov a researcher at the russian centre for arab and islamic studies at the institute of oriental studies in moscow told anadolu over the past two weeks israeli officials have repeatedly hinted at launching a ground offensive in gaza all while heavily bombarding the besieged palestinian territory the relentless israeli attacks have now killed more than 5000 palestinians among them over 2000 children and 1100 women the number of people injured in gaza is now over 15200 according to official figures read israel think tank linked to netanyahu promotes unique opportunity to ethnically cleanse gaza israel has targeted all areas of the gaza strip hitting densely populated residential areas hospitals and other civilian sites it has also cut off basic supplies such as water electricity and humanitarian aid to more than 22 million people in the gaza strip israel maintains that all of this is a response to the 7 october military operation by hamas and its subsequent rocket attacks on israeli areas which have now claimed more than 1400 lives one of the options is a ground operation with the use of powerful bombs which is something that the israeli leadership has spoken about said dolgov he said this would be aimed at destroying the underground structures of hamas before a ground offensive which will lead to significant casualties the alternative according to dolgov is to limit the operation to airstrikes and a local offensive in some areas where there are positions of hamas militants with this method the israeli forces will not completely destroy the gaza strip not level it to the ground he added other analysts and experts around the world have also been talking about two main scenarios for an israeli ground attack on gaza the first is called the fallujah model after the iraqi city of that name where us forces launched a largescale ground attack in 2014 while the second is the mosul model of 2017 when the international coalition against the daesh terror group focused more on an air assault engaging ground forces at minimum extent however experts have warned that both versions resulted in significant casualties red line for arab muslim parties dolgov believes that any form of israeli ground attack on gaza runs the risk of expanding the conflict many arab and muslim sides have stated that such a ground operation is a red line this was said by iran hezbollah shia iraqi militia units that are allies of hezbollah representatives of the ansar allah houthi movement in yemen he said arab countries have also warned that they consider a ground operation an unacceptable option he added dolgov urged israel to analyze the consequences of its actions warning that they could spark another global wave of antiisraeli protests we are seeing a wave of antiisraeli protests almost all over the world im not even talking about arab countries we see it in european countries in the us as well as in the countries of the islamic world he said how will israel like to live in a situation where the entire arab and muslim world is united against it and theres the economic political and the constant military threat to israel from arab neighbours what will this give israel even with the us support position of arab countries in the 1973 arabisraeli war when several arab countries fought against israel the persian gulf states helped them by halting oil supplies to western countries dolgov said now there is no oil embargo to israeli supporters because the situation is different there is no direct military confrontation between arab countries and israel he said hamas is a movement that has authority in the gaza strip but it is still not an arab state although it enjoys the support of some countries and regional forces he added at this stage arab countries along with other states are trying to resolve this military situation to stop hostilities through diplomatic means he said another important development in the current escalation is iran a shia country which has become one of the main supporters of hamas a sunni movement according to dolgov hamas is a sunni movement iran is a shia country but they are united by the goals since both iran and the hamas movement oppose as they say the us hegemony they oppose what they put as israels aggressive actions israels creeping occupation of palestinian lands he said he said the escalation in the gaza strip has also narrowed the divide between hamas and the palestinian authority the intrapalestinian split is related to ideological factors for example disputes about whether a palestinian state would be an islamic or secular one he said these differences exist and prevent the creation of a unified palestinian movement recently the two sides have managed to find closer positions and the current situation is also contributing to this said dolgov however the differences have not completely disappeared yet read iran will strike haifa if israel invades gaza strip the views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of

      "last weekend when iranianbacked houthi rebels in yemen launched missiles hitting three commercial ships in the southern red sea the united states refrained from striking back since then the houthis have sharply escalated their attacks against ships as they sail toward the narrow bab elmandeb strait yet the us remains silent though us navy ships have shot down an array of drones headed their way believed to have been launched by the militant group from territory it controls in yemen the question remains why the us military is not striking back these actions mark a stark difference from its multiple strikes against iranbacked militias in iraq and syria which have fired rockets missiles and drones at bases housing american forces in both countries so far the us has avoided military retaliation a marked departure from its previous responses to attacks in iraq and syria no one has been reported hurt in the houthi incidents although the commercial ships suffered some damage and us officials argue that the houthis havent technically targeted us vessels or forces a subtlety that navy ship captains watching the incoming drones may question heres a look at the houthis and their increasing attacks and why the us believes it is more acceptable to bomb some iranianlinked targets than others who are the houthis and whats going on in yemen houthi rebels swept down from their northern stronghold in yemen and seized the capital sanaa in 2014 launching a grinding war a saudiled coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore yemens exiled internationally recognised government to power years of bloody inconclusive fighting against the saudiled coalition settled into a stalemated proxy war between saudi arabia and iran causing widespread hunger and misery in yemen the arab worlds poorest country the war has killed more than 150000 people including fighters and civilians and created one of the worlds worst humanitarian disasters killing tens of thousands more a ceasefire that technically ended more than a year ago is still largely being honoured saudi arabia and the rebels have done some prisoner swaps and a houthi delegation was invited to highlevel peace talks in riyadh in september as part of a wider détente the kingdom has reached with iran while they reported positive results there is still no permanent peace why are houthis attacking ships the houthis have sporadically targeted ships in the region over time but the attacks have increased since the start of the war between israel and hamas and spiked after an explosion on 17 october at a hospital in gaza killed and injured many houthi leaders have insisted israel is their target after the weekend attacks houthi military spokesman brigadier general yahya saree said the group wants to prevent israeli ships from navigating the red sea and gulf of aden until the israeli aggression against our steadfast brothers in the gaza strip stops also read yemen civil war who are the houthis that saudi arabia is holding talks with will this end the conflict one of the commercial ships hit on sunday the unity explorer has a tenuous israeli link it is owned by a british firm that includes dan david ungar who lives in israel as one of its officers israeli media identified ungar as being the son of israeli shipping billionaire abraham rami ungar but any israel connections to other ships are unclear sundays flurry of attacks included missiles that hit the unity explorer the number 9 and the sophie ii all bulk carriers throughout that day the uss carney a navy destroyer shot down three drones that were headed toward the ship and also went to the aid of the commercial vessels on wednesday the uss mason shot down a drone heading in its direction in a statement us central command said we cannot assess at this time whether the carney was a target of the drones why has the us not retaliated while the us has carried out airstrikes on iranianback militias in iraq and syria that have targeted american troops in 77 different attacks since 17 october the military has not yet retaliated against the houthis that reluctance reflects political sensitivities and stems largely from broader biden administration concerns about upending the shaky truce in yemen and triggering a wider conflict in the region the white house wants to preserve the truce and is wary of taking action that could open up another war front us officials warn that military action is an option and they havent taken it off the table but both publicly and privately officials stress that there is a difference between the iraq and syria bombings and the houthi attacks iranbacked militia have launched oneway attack drones rockets or closerange ballistic missiles at bases in iraq 37 times and in syria 40 times dozens of troops have suffered minor injuries in most cases traumatic brain injuries in all instances so far the personnel have returned to work also read why have yemens houthis hijacked an indiabound ship hows this linked to the war in response the us has retaliated with airstrikes three times in syria since 17 october targeting weapons depots and other facilities linked directly to irans revolutionary guard corps and the militias it struck multiple sites in iraq late last month after a militia group for the first time fired shortrange ballistic missiles at us forces at the al asad air base the houthis meanwhile have fired missiles at vessels in the red sea launched drones and missiles targeting israel and sent drones in the direction of navy ships also last month houthis seized a vehicle transport ship linked to israel in the red sea off yemen and still hold the vessel houthi missiles landed near another us warship after it assisted a vessel linked to israel that had briefly been seized by gunmen defending the lack of retaliation for those attacks has forced us officials to dance on the head of a pin in one breath the pentagon officials say the navy ships shot down the houthi drones heading toward them because they were deemed a threat but in the next breath officials say the us assesses that the ships were not the target that determination often comes later after intelligence assessments review telemetry and other data that however is certainly no comfort to sailors on the ships who watch the radar track of incoming drones and must make rapid decisions about whether it represents a threat to the ship at the same time the us has consistently said it wants to protect free navigation of the seas however the houthi actions have prompted the international maritime security construct to issue a warning for ships transiting the red sea and bab elmandeb it says ships should choose routes as far from yemeni waters as possible travel at night and not stop because that makes them an easier target this week the us said it was talking with allies about using a naval task force to escort commercial ships in the red sea about 38 countries participate in a similar task force in the region largely to battle piracy off the coast of somalia officials have to discuss the issue with allies to see who wants to be involved in a new effort can the us stop wider conflict in west asia the biden administration has talked persistently about the need to avoid escalating the israelhamas war into a broader regional conflict so far strikes on the iranianbacked groups in iraq and syria have not broadened the conflict said major general pat ryder pentagon press secretary so its not clear if targeted strikes against houthi weapons depots or similar sites which also have iranian support would cross a line and trigger a wider war we will continue to consult with international allies and partners on an appropriate way to protect commercial shipping going through that region and at the same time ensure we do what we need to do to protect our forces said ryder with inputs from ap\n",

       "'israel launching a ground offensive in the gaza strip is a certainty but what remains to be seen is how the israeli military goes about it according to a russian analyst there are different ways that any force could employ a ground military operation taking into consideration various aspects boris dolgov a researcher at the russian centre for arab and islamic studies at the institute of oriental studies in moscow told anadolu over the past two weeks israeli officials have repeatedly hinted at launching a ground offensive in gaza all while heavily bombarding the besieged palestinian territory the relentless israeli attacks have now killed more than 5000 palestinians among them over 2000 children and 1100 women the number of people injured in gaza is now over 15200 according to official figures read israel think tank linked to netanyahu promotes unique opportunity to ethnically cleanse gaza israel has targeted all areas of the gaza strip hitting densely populated residential areas hospitals and other civilian sites it has also cut off basic supplies such as water electricity and humanitarian aid to more than 22 million people in the gaza strip israel maintains that all of this is a response to the 7 october military operation by hamas and its subsequent rocket attacks on israeli areas which have now claimed more than 1400 lives one of the options is a ground operation with the use of powerful bombs which is something that the israeli leadership has spoken about said dolgov he said this would be aimed at destroying the underground structures of hamas before a ground offensive which will lead to significant casualties the alternative according to dolgov is to limit the operation to airstrikes and a local offensive in some areas where there are positions of hamas militants with this method the israeli forces will not completely destroy the gaza strip not level it to the ground he added other analysts and experts around the world have also been talking about two main scenarios for an israeli ground attack on gaza the first is called the fallujah model after the iraqi city of that name where us forces launched a largescale ground attack in 2014 while the second is the mosul model of 2017 when the international coalition against the daesh terror group focused more on an air assault engaging ground forces at minimum extent however experts have warned that both versions resulted in significant casualties red line for arab muslim parties dolgov believes that any form of israeli ground attack on gaza runs the risk of expanding the conflict many arab and muslim sides have stated that such a ground operation is a red line this was said by iran hezbollah shia iraqi militia units that are allies of hezbollah representatives of the ansar allah houthi movement in yemen he said arab countries have also warned that they consider a ground operation an unacceptable option he added dolgov urged israel to analyze the consequences of its actions warning that they could spark another global wave of antiisraeli protests we are seeing a wave of antiisraeli protests almost all over the world im not even talking about arab countries we see it in european countries in the us as well as in the countries of the islamic world he said how will israel like to live in a situation where the entire arab and muslim world is united against it and theres the economic political and the constant military threat to israel from arab neighbours what will this give israel even with the us support position of arab countries in the 1973 arabisraeli war when several arab countries fought against israel the persian gulf states helped them by halting oil supplies to western countries dolgov said now there is no oil embargo to israeli supporters because the situation is different there is no direct military confrontation between arab countries and israel he said hamas is a movement that has authority in the gaza strip but it is still not an arab state although it enjoys the support of some countries and regional forces he added at this stage arab countries along with other states are trying to resolve this military situation to stop hostilities through diplomatic means he said another important development in the current escalation is iran a shia country which has become one of the main supporters of hamas a sunni movement according to dolgov hamas is a sunni movement iran is a shia country but they are united by the goals since both iran and the hamas movement oppose as they say the us hegemony they oppose what they put as israels aggressive actions israels creeping occupation of palestinian lands he said he said the escalation in the gaza strip has also narrowed the divide between hamas and the palestinian authority the intrapalestinian split is related to ideological factors for example disputes about whether a palestinian state would be an islamic or secular one he said these differences exist and prevent the creation of a unified palestinian movement recently the two sides have managed to find closer positions and the current situation is also contributing to this said dolgov however the differences have not completely disappeared yet read iran will strike haifa if israel invades gaza strip the views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of
