[Full text of Netanyahu\\u2019s statement is at the bottom of this article.]\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Biden Administration is continuing to pressure Israel into a post-war capitulation that would leave the \\u201cpay to slay\\u201d Palestinian Authority government, which rewards Arab terrorists with lifetime monthly payments for murdering Israelis, in control over Gaza.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is important to clarify this right now. Because between friends one must tell the truth and not foster illusions, all the more so on an existential and fateful issue like this,\\u201d Netanyahu said in a lengthy statement to the nation on Saturday night.\\n\\n\\u201cSo I repeat to our friends: after the elimination of Hamas, the Gaza Strip will be demilitarized, it will be under the security control of Israel, and there will be no factor in it that will threaten us and no factor that will educate its children to destroy us,\\u201d he emphasized.\\n\\nIn other words, no Ramallah government in Gaza.\\n\\nUS Leaves Open Possibility of Hamas Keeping Power, as Ramallah Throws Hamas a Lifeline\\n\\nA spokesperson for the US State Department told the Tazpit Press Service on Thursday that \\u201cPalestinians\\u2019 voices and aspirations must be at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza, unified with the West Bank under the [Palestinian Authority].\\n\\n\\u201cWe remain committed to working with the PA and Palestinian leadership on the critical work of strengthening Palestinian institutions \\u2026 and reinforcing commitments to nonviolence and countering terrorism,\\u201d the spokesperson added.\\n\\nAdd to that President Joe Biden\\u2019s continued insistence that Israel plan ahead for a mandatory \\u201ctwo-state solution.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is, to be clear, delusional thinking.\\n\\nIt is the Palestinian Authority government in Ramallah that continues to this day to reward terrorists who attack and try to kill Israelis with lifetime monthly payments. The families of those who die in such attempts are likewise rewarded.\\n\\nSuch payments are grounds for terminating foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority under the \\u201cTaylor Force Act\\u201d in the United States, but who\\u2019s paying attention to that small detail?\\n\\nApparently, the White House is not concerned. Nor are those in living in the Palestinian Authority-controlled areas of Judea and Samaria, whose admiration for Hamas has skyrocketed since October 7.\\n\\nNearly 75% of PA Arabs Say Hamas Was Right to Attack Israel on Oct. 7\\n\\nNearly three in four Palestinian Authority Arabs believes that Hamas was right to launch its October 7th invasion of Israel, massacre at least 1,200 citizens and dual nationals and kidnap another 240 people to Gaza, according to the latest survey by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.\\n\\nThe Ramallah-based institute polled 1,231 Arab adults in the Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria between Nov. 22 and Dec. 2, and found that 72 percent of respondents think Hamas was \\u201ccorrect\\u201d in carrying out the slaughter.\\n\\nWorse, 89 percent of respondents denied the terrorists committed war crimes on October 7th, and a full 95 percent claimed Israel has breached international law during its defensive operation against Hamas in Gaza.\\n\\nMore ominously: More than half of respondents said Hamas is \\u201cthe most deserving of representing and leading the Palestinian people today.\\u201d\\n\\nIf an election were held in the Palestinian Authority today, Hamas would receive 51 percent of the vote. In a leadership runoff between current PA chief Mahmoud Abbas would easily be ousted by current Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh, with the Hamas official getting 78 percent of the vote, and 88 percent of Arabs in the Palestinian Authority saying Abbas needs to resign.\\n\\nFull Statement by PM Netanyahu:\\n\\n\\u201cCitizens of Israel,\\n\\nWe are in a war for our existence, in which we must continue until victory, despite the international pressure and despite the unbearable cost that the war is exacting from us in our fallen sons and daughters. The State of Israel mourns the tragic deaths of three of our hostages: Alon Shamriz, Samar Talalka and Yotam Haim.\\n\\nWhen I was updated about the terrible tragedy \\u2013 it struck me hard. Alon, Samar and Yotam survived hell for 72 days, they were almost one step from freedom, they had touched redemption and then disaster struck. It broke my heart. It broke the entire country\\u2019s heart. Our heart goes out to the families in their time of deep mourning.\\n\\nAt this difficult time, it is important for me to stand by our soldiers. They are giving their lives to achieve a crushing victory over our enemies and return our hostages. We are doing \\u2013 and will do \\u2013 everything to safeguard the lives of our soldiers, each and every one of them, and we will use all means so that they are not hurt.\\n\\nSince the tragedy yesterday, one thought has followed me: \\u2018What would have happened if something had been different?\\u2019 I am certain that we all share this thought. We were so close to embracing them now. But I regret that we cannot turn back the clock. Everyone who has fought on the battlefield knows that the distance between victory and disaster is a hair\\u2019s breadth. Out of the immense pain, we will learn and implement the lessons, and we will not relent in the military and diplomatic effort to safely return home all of our hostages.\\n\\nWith all of the deep sorrow, I would like to clarify: The military pressure is essential both for returning the hostages and achieving victory over our enemies. Without the military pressure, we would not have succeeded in creating an outline that led to the release of 110 hostages. And only continued military pressure will lead to the release of all of our hostages. My directive to the negotiating team is based on this pressure, without which we would have nothing.\\n\\nCitizens of Israel,\\n\\nOn Thursday evening, we lit the last candle of Chanukah. In those days, in the fight for our existence, four of the five Hasmoneans fell and ensured the victory of Israel over an enemy that wanted to eradicate our people. In these days, in fierce battles in Jebalya, Sajaiya, Khan Yunis and other places, the Maccabees of our time have fallen in the fight against an enemy that wants to destroy us. We have lost dear heroes, soldiers and commander of unparalleled bravery and dedication, heroes that fell in battle so that we might continue to live in our land, so that the thread of our lives will not be cut.\\n\\nTogether with you, citizens of Israel, I stand by the bereaved families. I cry with them. Coming from a bereaved family, I know that until their last day they will not stop missing their loved ones and crying over what and who they have lost. I spoke with the widow and parents of Lt.-Col. Tomer Greenberg, the commander of the Golani Brigade\\u2019s 13th Battalion, who fell heroically this week together with his soldiers and those under his command. I told them what I say to all of my brothers and sisters from bereaved families, I know that the pain which rends your heart will never relent. But there is one comfort: To ensure that our heroes will not have fallen in vain, to ensure that we will continue to fight until absolute victory is achieved.\\n\\nI also made this determination clear to US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan with whom I met on Thursday. I greatly appreciate the US support for Israel \\u2013 in the assistance in returning our hostages, in the supply of munitions for the IDF, in blocking the attempts at the UN to stop the fighting, and in other things. I reiterate to our friends: We are more determined than ever to continue to the end \\u2013 until we eliminate Hamas, return all of our hostages, and ensure that, with G-d\\u2019s help, there will not be any element that educates for terrorism, finances terrorism and dispatches terrorism.\\n\\nI say this to the entire world; many around the world understand this and I repeat it this evening as well. This is not \\u2018politics\\u2019 but policy. This is my policy and today I can say: This is the desire of the vast majority of the country. I will not allow us to replace Hamastan with Fatahstan, that we replace Khan Yunis with Jenin. I will not allow the State of Israel to repeat the fateful mistake of Oslo, which brought to the heart of our country and to Gaza, the most extreme elements in the Arab world, which are committed to the destruction of the State of Israel and who educate their children to this end.\\n\\nThe debate between Hamas and Fatah is not \\u2018whether\\u2019 to eliminate the State of Israel but \\u2018how\\u2019 to do it. According to a poll that was carried out a few days ago, 82% of the Palestinian population in Judea and Samaria justifies the horrific massacre of October 7th. As of this moment, the Palestinian Authority senior leadership simply refuses to condemn the massacre and some of them even praise it openly. They will control Gaza on \\u2018the day after\\u2019? Haven\\u2019t we learned anything? As the Prime Minister of Israel, I will not allow that to happen.\\n\\nIt is important to make this clear now because among friends we must tell the truth and not foster illusions, how much more so on an existential and fateful issue such as this. Then I reiterate to our friends: After the elimination of Hamas, the Gaza Strip will be demilitarized, will be under Israeli security control, and no element in it will either threaten us or educate its children to destroy us.\\n\\nI want to tell you, citizens of Israel, that while victory will take time, we are determined to continue until the end, despite the immense pain, despite the bereavement that rends our hearts, despite the international pressure. We will continue until the end. Nothing will stop us \\u2013 until we achieve victory.\\n\\nTogether we will fight and, with G-d\\u2019s help, together we will win.\\u201d\",\n          \"Good morning, Broadsheet readers! CVS is planning to make prescription prices more transparent for patients, Liz Cheney is considering a third-party campaign for the White House, and Sheryl Sandberg speaks out against sexual violence in the Israel-Hamas war. Have a good Wednesday!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2013 Sandberg\\u2019s new call. On Monday afternoon, former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg joined a group of activists at the UN calling for a wider global response to sexual violence committed against Israeli women by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attacks.\\n\\nSandberg first spoke out on this issue via a CNN op-ed published in late November. The founder of LeanIn.org, Sandberg often weighs in on women\\u2019s workplace issues and sometimes on related matters of sexism and gender bias. But wading into the Israel-Hamas war, via this particular topic of sexual violence, is perhaps her boldest stance yet. \\u201cFor over a decade, I\\u2019ve been urging women to lean in,\\u201d Sandberg said in her speech at the UN. \\u201cNow I call on everyone to speak out.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter Oct. 7, Israel began investigating incidents of sexual violence and rape during the attacks. Witnesses reported seeing sexual violence, according to the Washington Post. Additional evidence included injuries to female survivors and to women and girls who were among the 1,200 people killed. Hamas has denied that its members committed sexual violence.\\n\\nAfter writing her op-ed, Sandberg joined Monday\\u2019s event, which was hosted by the Embassy of Israel and featured a mix of Israeli officials, American political leaders including Hillary Clinton and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), and other activists like Mandana Dayani, the founder of I Am a Voter and former president of Archewell. Some participants presented disturbing videos, photos, and descriptions of sexual violence from Oct. 7.\\n\\nSheryl Sandberg at the UN Headquarters in New York on Dec. 4, 2023. Lev Radin\\u2014Sipa USA/AP Images\\n\\nIn her piece, and in a speech she gave at the UN, Sandberg framed the matter as a unifying one: \\u201cSomething we can all agree on\\u201d is that \\u201crape should never be used as an act of war.\\u201d However, agreement seems to be elusive when it comes to anything related to Israel and Palestine, even this issue.\\n\\nSpeakers expressed anger at the UN, UN Women, and women\\u2019s organizations for not immediately speaking out or not speaking out forcefully enough about sexual violence experienced by Israeli women. In a statement on Friday, UN Women said it \\u201cunequivocally condemn[s] the brutal attacks by Hamas\\u201d and said it was \\u201calarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence during those attacks.\\u201d It demanded that all cases of gender-based violence be \\u201cduly investigated and prosecuted.\\u201d\\n\\nStill, many human rights groups have tread lightly in this tense and fast-moving time, as Israel\\u2019s bombardment of Gaza continued (including this week). Speakers at Monday\\u2019s event expressed anger that opposition to Israel\\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza (which has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians) seemed to be keeping global women\\u2019s organizations from speaking out against sexual violence against Israeli women.\\n\\nSandberg told me during an interview in the UN\\u2019s Hall of Flags after the event that she was hopeful the issue could still unify. \\u201cIt\\u2019s never too late to say something you should have said all along,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI welcome any organization to join us and speak out.\\u201d\\n\\nI asked Sandberg if she had any advice for business leaders still figuring out how to discuss Israel and Palestine internally or externally; she declined to comment and said she preferred to stay focused on the \\u201cunequivocal statement that we need to speak out against rape.\\u201d I asked if she had any advice for business leaders who are navigating discussing that particular issue of sexual violence; the advice she offered was to \\u201cjoin us.\\u201d She also declined to comment on the state of business\\u2019s response to the conflict, and on whether she would be able to take up this cause if she were still an executive at Meta. (Sandberg still sits on Meta\\u2019s board of directors.)\\n\\nSandberg\\u2019s CNN op-ed published about six weeks after Hamas\\u2019s attack. As she decided how to publicly engage on this crisis, Sandberg says she \\u201cfelt a responsibility to speak out.\\u201d \\u201cI was enjoying a relatively private\\u2014still active with my foundation, but more private\\u2014life,\\u201d she told me. \\u201cI felt I had a responsibility to speak out\\u2026You can be for any side in this conflict.

CVS Health says that the new price formula will more closely align with what the company pays for the drugs. It remains to be seen if the new approach will lower costs for patients.

India was the largest importer with a 9.8% global market share, according to SIPRI\\u2019s data.\\n\\nSaudi arms imports during this four-year period fell 28% in comparison to the period from 2014 to 2018, but the kingdom's imports had reached record levels in those years. Qatar\\u2019s arms imports increased a whopping 396% in 2019-2023 when compared to the previous four years. The United States was the largest provider of weapons to both countries, accounting for 75% of Saudi Arabia\\u2019s imports and 45% of Qatar\\u2019s. France came in second for each country, providing Saudi Arabia with 7.6% of its imports and Qatar with 25%, according to the data.\\n\\nThe US State Department approved a $582 million arms sale to Saudi Arabia in early December. The sale included hardware and software for Saudi Arabia's RE-3A surveillance aircraft. Later that month, the department approved a $1 billion sale of military training programs to the kingdom.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia is reportedly in talks to buy France's Rafale fighter jets. Last December, France and Saudi Arabia signed a plan for cooperation on military industry. In 2019, Saudi Arabia inked a preliminary deal to build warships in the kingdom with France's Naval Group.\\n\\nEgypt was the seventh-largest arms importer with 4% of global imports, while Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates were 12th and 14th largest with 2.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Combined, Gulf states and Egypt accounted for 25.8% of global arms imports between 2019 and 2023.\\n\\nConcerns about Iran and its regional proxies drove weapons sales to the Gulf, according to the institute. \\u201cSome states in the Gulf region have imported large volumes of arms to use against the Houthis in Yemen and to counter Iranian influence,\\u201d read the report.\\n\\nThose concerns include Iran\\u2019s nuclear program. Last September, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom would develop nuclear weapons if Iran were to do so. The Islamic Republic says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.\\n\\nGulf states have also expressed concerns about Iran\\u2019s ballistic missiles program and support for regional proxies including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\\n\\nIran-Saudi tensions calmed somewhat following the China-brokered agreement that reestablished relations between the two countries in March 2023. However, the kingdom and the Islamic Republic have made little tangible progress toward resolving their differences, Al-Monitor\\u2019s correspondent in Tehran wrote last month.\\n\\nNorth African imports fall\\n\\nMorocco\\u2019s arms imports fell 46% between 2019 and 2023 in comparison to the previous four years, while Algeria\\u2019s fell 77% in the same time period. The institute did not note any reasons for the decrease, but said the decline in Moroccan and Algerian imports were the primary driver for Africa\\u2019s collective major arms imports falling 52%.\\n\\nRussia was Algeria\\u2019s largest supplier, accounting for 48% of the market share, while the United States was Morocco\\u2019s largest supplier at 69%.\\n\\nMorocco is increasingly looking to Turkey for weapons and acquired two armed vehicles from Ankara in January. Morocco had been looking to import more from Israel as well, but ties have become strained over the Gaza war, Francisco Serrano wrote in a memo for Al-Monitor Pro last week.\\n\\nMorocco\\u2019s second- and third-largest arms suppliers between 2019 and 2023 were France with 14% and Israel with 11%, according to SIPRI.\\n\\nIsrael in top 10 exporters\\n\\nIsrael was the only country in the Middle East and North Africa in the top 10 arms exporters, coming in at ninth on the list and accounting for 2.4% of all exports.\\n\\nMajor Israeli defense manufacturers have reportedly delayed more than $1 billion in weapons sales since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October due to growing domestic need. However, Israeli military exports to India have been unaffected by the downturn.\\n\\nThe United States was the largest exporter with a 42% market share, followed by France and Russia with 11% each and China with 5.8%.\\n\\nRussia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and the war is ongoing.\\n\\nSIPRI noted a sharp decline in Russian arms exports between 2019 and 2023. The exports fell 53% in comparison to the previous four years. The decrease is related to a dwindling number of Russian export destinations amid the Ukraine war. Russia exported major arms to 31 states in 2019 but only 12 in 2023, according to the report.\\n\\nTurkey was the 11th largest arms exporter from 2019 to 2023 with a 1.6% global market share.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dateModified\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"scrapedDate\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2949,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/\",\n          \"https://www.upi.com/\",\n          \"https://www.cleveland19.com/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 32227,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"AUS vs PAK Test: Warner's powerful 164 takes Australia to 346-5 on Day 1\",\n          \"COP28 Summit and India | Is climate fatigue setting in?\",\n          \"Biden convinced Netanyahu not to strike Hezbollah after Hamas attacks, says report\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters Thursday evening that \\\"if the resolution is put forward as is, then we can support it.\\\" She denied that the draft resolution had been watered down, saying it was \\\"very strong\\\" and \\\"fully supported by the Arab group.\\\"ADVERTISEMENTgoogletag.cmd.push(function() {googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-8052921-2'); }); Diplomatic wrangling at United Nations headquarters in Manhattan -- causing the vote to be postponed several times this week -- has come against the backdrop of deteriorating conditions in Gaza and a mounting death toll. \\\"Some of this language is slightly absurd,\\\" said International Crisis Group analyst Richard Gowan.

Mounting death toll It demands all sides \\\"allow and facilitate the use of all... routes to and throughout the entire Gaza Strip, including border crossings... for the provision of humanitarian assistance.\\\" The resolution also requests the appointment of a UN humanitarian coordinator to oversee and verify third-country aid to Gaza. An earlier text had said that the aid mechanism to accelerate the delivery of relief would be \\\"exclusively\\\" under UN control. It now states it would be managed in consultation with \\\"all relevant parties\\\" -- meaning Israel would retain operational oversight of aid deliveries. Israel on Thursday bombed a newly reopened aid crossing, Hamas authorities said. \\\"Every single day we are working on increasing humanitarian assistance on the ground,\\\" Thomas-Greenfield said the same day. Members of the 15-member Security Council have been grappling for days to find common ground on the resolution, as criticism mounts over the body's lack of action since the start of the war. Israel, backed by its ally the United States, has opposed the term \\\"cease-fire,\\\" and Washington has used its veto twice to thwart resolutions backed by a majority of other members. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday there would be no cease-fire in Gaza until the \\\"elimination\\\" of Hamas.

Israel has responded with a relentless air and ground campaign. The Hamas government's media office in the Gaza Strip said Friday that 20,057 people have been killed, among them 8,000 children and 6,200 women.

if any impact the vote will have on the ground where Gazans have been forced into crowded shelters or tents and are struggling to find food fuel water and medical care UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres said a humanitarian ceasefire is the only way for aid to be effectively delivered The issue was not the number of aid trucks he said but the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to aid distribution Famine looms Immediately after the UN vote Israel again vowed to fight on until Hamas is eliminated and hostages are freed Israel will continue the war

statement Raut expressed his view that the occasion was Dussehra a day traditionally associated with auspiciousness However he criticized Shinde for focusing on contentious matters and likened him to Hamas and Al Qaeda of Maharashtra Raut also mentioned that Shinde had in his Dussehra speech questioned the alliance between Shiv Sena UBT and Akhilesh Yadavs Samajwadi Party citing an incident from 1990 when Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav had reportedly ordered the use of force against karsevaks in Ayodhya This event marked the first time that Thackeray and Shinde leaders of the

Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty CTBT was approved by 156 votes to zero in the upper house after the lower house also passed it unanimously It now goes to President Vladimir Putin for signing Putin had requested the change to mirror the position of the United States which signed the CTBT in 1996 but never ratified it Though it has never formally come into force the CTBT has made nuclear testing a taboo  no country except North Korea has conducted a test involving a nuclear explosion this century  What is Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  What is the purpose of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  How did CTBT come into being Advertisement  For Your InformationThe United States conducted the worlds first successful nuclear weapons test in July 1945 Four years later the Soviet Union tested their first nuclear weapon These tests triggered a decadeslong arms race between the two superpowers Between 1945 and 1996 more than 2000 nuclear tests were carried out  1032 of them by the United States and 715 of them by the Soviet Union according to the UN Britain carried out 45 tests France 210 and China 45 The radioactive fallout from those tests drew criticism from around the globe The international communitys concern about the effects on health and the environment continued to grow the US Department of States article History of CTBT said As a result several attempts to curb the explosive tests were made The 1963 Limited Nuclear TestBan Treaty LTBT was one of the first such attempts It prohibited nuclear testing in the atmosphere outer space and underwater but underground tests were still permitted To tackle the limitations of LTBT a comprehensive test ban was discussed during the negotiation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1968 However no agreement was reached on the issue Six years later the US and Soviet Union agreed to sign the Threshold Test Ban Treaty TTBT which established a nuclear threshold by banning the two countries from conducting tests that would produce a yield exceeding 150 kilotons equivalent to 150000 tons of TNT The mutual restraint imposed by the Treaty reduced the explosive force of new nuclear warheads and bombs which could otherwise be tested for weapons systems The TTBT was not intended as a substitute for a comprehensive test ban the article added A major breakthrough only came after the Cold War ended around 1990 and the disintegration of the Soviet Union As the geopolitical tensions simmered down the UN took advantage of the situation and adopted the CTBT which put a blanket ban on the explosive testing of nuclear weapons on September 10 1996 and it opened for signature on September 24 1996  Which key countries havent ratified CTBT  Did US ratify CTBT  India USA NPT and CTBTIssues and Indias

earlier this month that Trinamool Congress member Mahua Moitra accepted bribes to ask questions in Parliament targeting the Adani Group The allegations by Dubey which he has since taken to Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and the Lokpal are based on information provided by Dehadrai which were confirmed by real estate developer Darshan Hiranandani subsequently Hiranandani a resident of Dubai has issued a sworn affidavit saying Moitra gave him her Parliament login and password so he could post questions on her behalf  How serious is Nishikant Dubeys accusation  For Your InformationEssentially the question is whether an MP is asking a question in return for some consideration and whether there is illegal gratification involved If this is established then it is a serious issue If an MP has asked questions and has done other parliamentary work on behalf of somebody who has paid a consideration then it should actually come to the Privileges Committee because it is a serious breach of privilege and contempt of the House This is true for all countries that have a parliamentary system In such a situation Parliament can exercise its right to expel the member from the House  What is exactly cash for query case  Has there been an allegation earlier about an MP handing over access to the Parliament website to someone else  Is there a rule that specifically

Natarajan CPIM and Kunwar Danish Ali BSP A Presiding Officers Conference held in Delhi in 1996 first mooted the idea of ethics panels for the two Houses Then Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman K R Narayanan constituted the Ethics Committee of the Upper House on March 4 1997 and it was inaugurated that May to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members and examine cases of misconduct referred to it The Rules applicable to the Committee of Privileges also apply to the ethics panel In the case of Lok Sabha a study group of the House Committee of Privileges after visiting Australia the UK and the US in 1997 to look into practices pertaining to the conduct and ethics of legislators recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee but it could not be taken up by Lok Sabha The Committee of Privileges finally recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee during the 13th Lok Sabha The late Speaker G M C Balayogi constituted an ad hoc Ethics Committee in 2000 which became a permanent part of the House only in 2015 In 2005 the two Houses adopted motions to expel 10 Lok Sabha MPs and one Rajya Sabha MP who were accused of agreeing to ask questions in Parliament for money The motion in Lok Sabha was based on the report of a special committee set up by the Speaker under Chandigarh MP P K Bansal to examine the issue In Rajya Sabha the complaint was examined by the House Ethics Committee The BJP which lost six MPs demanded that the Bansal Committees report be sent to the Privileges Committee so that the parliamentarians could defend themselves Former Lok Sabha Secretary General P D T Achary said there was a lot of evidence in the 2005 case  it was based on a sting operation  the challenge in the Mahua Moitra case will be to link the questions asked by the TMC MP to a money trail Any person can complain against a Member through another Lok Sabha MP along with evidence of the alleged misconduct and an affidavit stating that the complaint is not false frivolous or vexatious If the Member himself complains the affidavit is not needed The Speaker can refer to the Committee any complaint against an MP The Committee does not entertain complaints based only on media reports or on matters that are sub judice The Committee makes a prima facie inquiry before deciding to examine a complaint It makes its recommendations after evaluating the complaint The

day The Indian Express published a report on how Mumbais civic body took its eyes off the garbage dumping and its burning the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ordered a complete ban on burning of garbage in the open Earlier the citys Guardian Minister Deepak Kesarkar said the BMC had sent notices to 6000 construction sites to install fogging machines and sprinklers At a press conference Wednesday Kesarkar also said the BMC is putting in place a process to soon start segregation of waste  extraction of pollutants from the garbage  at its two landfills in Deonar and Kanjurmarg The new

burden on the citys residentsConnect the dots  Why has the air quality been bad in Mumbai of late  Mumbais overall Air Quality Index touched 191 way worse than Delhis 84how this happened  What are the reasons given by experts for the worsening AQI in Mumbai  Meteorological conditions play a role in pollution But it should be clear that the weather or climate cannot generate air pollution Air quality deteriorates mainly due to anthropogenic sources of emissions whether local or distant Meteorological conditions only help to manoeuvre the pollutants in the airDiscuss  Mumbais geography gives it a distinct advantageHow  The usual is becoming unusual and getting triggered by additional anthropogenic factorsCite the reasons for Mumbai pollution  Do You KnowLast winter the city experienced recordbreaking particulate pollution which was largely related to the unusual triple dip La Nina conditions  understood as linked to climate change An abnormal drop in surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean had a telling effect on coastal wind speeds around Mumbai There was scarcely any wind reversal from across the Arabian Sea which would otherwise occur every two to three days and disperse pollutants in the air In other words the emission from various anthropogenic sources was not cleaned up and the city experienced its worst air of the decade La Nina has gone this year However the withdrawal of the monsoon was delayed till October The withdrawal time of monsoon always plays a critical role in Mumbais air quality The withdrawal is always followed by an anticyclonic circulation that was right above Mumbai and the surrounding regions during the initial days of October This led to weak ventilation in the city At the same time the transport level winds much above the surface in the atmosphere were moderately fast and were blowing towards Mumbai from Lonavala and Khandala in the Sahyadri ranges around 2040 ft above sea level These chilly moderate winds are capable of transporting pollutants towards Mumbai When these winds started losing energy they descended near Navi Mumbai and the surrounding coastal region There they encountered warmer winds which were laden with local dust When this dustfilled cloud pushed towards Mumbai it was arrested because of the calm winds deteriorating the citys air quality The fact that PM10 continues to be the major pollutant in the city and the visibility of Mumbais residents has been impacted suggests that the major blame for the current worsening of air quality should be ascribed to coarser particles largely a result of dust emissions Many development and construction activities are being undertaken across the city  these include the coastal corridor work on the Metro and other digging activities Unfavourable weather conditions exploit the emissions from such sources to create pollution Under normal conditions windblown dust contributes 26 per cent of PM10 and 19 per cent in PM25 However the spike in pollution indicates that PM10 levels have gone up significantly Under normal conditions the transport sector contributes to 14 per cent of PM10 and 31 per cent of PM25 However the stagnating

commands  For Your InformationIn the simplest words it is a unified command under which all the resources of the Army the Navy and the Air Force are pooled depending on the threat perception The commands could be geographical  like looking at a border with a particular country  or thematic like a command for all maritime threats Several nations in the world have theatre commands including the United States and China The idea of creating an integrated triServices command in India is not new  it had been recommended at various levels after the Kargil conflict When Gen Rawat was appointed Chief of Defence Staff in January 2020 with a mandate to raise such commands within his threeyear tenure the idea was finally brought to the design table After his appointment Gen Rawat had commissioned studies within each of the armed forces to come up with ideas of what these commands could look like These were headed by the Vice Chiefs of the forces Last year Gen Rawat had suggested that the first of these commands the Air Defence Command could come up by the end of 2020 However the process has been delayed due to multiple factors including the Covid19 pandemic Officials are now suggesting that some of the new commands could be rolled out by the end of this year A model with four to five integrated triServices theatre commands is under discussion with each command headed by a threestar officer This officer the theatre commander will report to the Chiefs of Staff Committee COSC which as the name suggests includes the three Service chiefs and is headed by the CDS as its permanent chairman This brings in a major change  the Service chiefs currently have all the operational control over their forces operational powers will now move to the COSC Each of these commands

and the cost of power procurement will increase as new RE contracts are layered on top of existing commitments for firm power Gridscale energy storage technologies are still expensive and experimental and are unlikely to be adopted at a large scale by the end of the decade Since most coalrich states have limited gridscale REdeployment they will have to import more power from other states This means

date On September 17 1949 Dr B R Ambedkar presented to the House the final version of the provision which included both Bharat and India Several members expressed themselves against the use of India which they saw as a reminder of the colonial past Seth Govind Das from Jabalpur preferred to place Bharat over India A popular demand by several members was also to underline that India was a substitute for Bharat in English language India that is Bharat are not beautiful words for the name of a country We should have put the words Bharat known as India also in foreign countries he said Hari Vishnu Kamath used the example of the Irish Constitution to argue that the word India was only a translation of Bharat If honourable colleagues in the House would take the trouble of referring to the Irish Constitution passed in 1937 they will see that the Irish Free State was one of the few countries in the modern world which changed its name on achieving freedom and the fourth article of its

Pant who represented the hill districts of the United Provinces made it clear that the people of Northern India wanted Bharatvarsha and nothing else Pant argued So far as the word India is concerned the Members seem to have and really I fail to understand why some attachment for it We must know that this name was given to our country by foreigners who having heard of the riches of this land were

within India and claiming Hindus face an imminent Hamaslike Islamist attack and insisting that only Prime Minister Narendra Modi can save India from it to expressing glee at the deaths of Palestinians and claiming the Congress was behind the attacks proBharatiya Janata Party BJP rightwing online spaces are furiously peddling Islamophobia and targeting the BJPs rivals with disinformation by using the IsraelHamas war as cover Within proBJP WhatsApp groups as well as Facebook pages and groups named after BJP leaders social media users have weaponised the ongoing war to push their Hindutva agendas deeper by training their guns at a familiar target Muslims Using photos and videos along with text messages the messaging in these groups seeks to convince users that Islam and Muslims were to be singularly blamed for the war Simultaneously it dehumanises the sufferings of Palestinians by branding them as jihadis and terrorists Since October 7 when Hamas launched air and land attacks against Israel over 1400 Israelis and nearly 6000 Palestinians have been killed Among the Palestinians are over 2300 children who were killed in Israeli bombing Yet across these groups jokes about their deaths as well as mocking their suffering were common Prateek Waghre policy director at the Internet Freedom Foundation said such messaging was part of a broader trend concerning propaganda in Indian rightwing spaces There has been a definite tendency over the last few years in India to try to incorporate global events into the constant narrative that paints mostly Muslims but sometimes even moderate Hindus as an enemy or a threat said Waghre Much of this Waghre said was owing to the religious angle of the conflict between the Jewish state of Israel and the Muslimdominated Palestine This author accessed 13 WhatsApp groups all of them expressing clear support for the Hindutva ideology the BJP Narendra Modi and the RSS through the names of the groups as well as the display photos generally featuring images of Modi and Adityanath The groups are not being named to protect the authors access The number of members in these groups range from anywhere around 50 to nearly 400 In addition the author accessed multiple Facebook groups and pages which displayed open affiliations to the BJP and its leaders Broadly much of the propaganda in these groups falls under four different themes  from dehumanising Palestinian suffering and delegitimising support for them to making the IsraelGaza war relatable by drawing historical Indian comparisons to it to warning Hindus about an Islamist attack and pitching the BJP and Modi as the countrys only hope to fight this Just like Kashmiri Hindus A significant proportion of messages on these groups attempts to try and make the war more relevant to an Indian audience It does this by drawing parallels to the situation but selectively The plight of Israelis these messages insist is like Kashmiri Hindus Circulating a video ostensibly of an Israeli family held hostage by Hamas terrorists the message asks readers to look at the fear on their faces This is the same what Kashmiri Hindus faced in 1990 sic the message says The purpose behind the comparison becomes clear at the end of the message Indian wokes will call it RSS propoganda in reality ISLAM IS PEACE LOVING RELIGION sic it says sarcastically Similarly Hamas is equated to Islamic invaders like Humayun and Babur both of them ostensibly attacking nonMuslims with similar brutality The corollary of these comparisons comes in a later bunch of messaging referring to the violence by Hamas the messages would remind readers of Jauhar believed to be the practice of selfimmolation by the wives and children of warriors in medieval times when the warrior was facing defeat One meme shows a photo of a halfcovered body purportedly of an Israeli woman being dragged by Hamas terrorists To Avoid This Our Hindu Women Did Jauhar During Mughals Era reads a caption with the image This is a commonlycirculated message On a Facebook page named Yogi Adityanath for PM 2024 with over 66000 followers the administrator of the page posts a similar message Hamas has made us understand why Hindu women committed Jauhar A warning for you Having convinced members of these groups that the war was a relatable one a large strand of messaging is focused on stoking fears of an imminent attack on Indians but especially Hindus by Hamaslike Islamist terrorists In the future India could also face conspiracies and attacks like Israel The possibility of Hindu women facing cruelty cant be ruled out the viral message warns To avoid this the message adds Hindus needed to be alert and do two things carry weapons and carry out a complete social boycott of Muslims Some messages claim Israel used to let 2000 Palestinians from Gaza into Israel everyday These 2000 apparently were secretly carrying out reconnaissance missions for the Hamas and were terrorists in disguise the messages claim Then the message points to the Muslims within India without naming them Now imagine we have 15 crore terrorists amidst us who we think share our DNA the message concludes The messaging in these groups doesnt just stop at warning of impending attacks but goes a step further and asks its audience to imagine how the conflict would even play out and stokes anger against Islamic nations When the civil war begins in India do you think the 59 Islamic countries will stand by you They will stand by the Muslims it insists You will always be the kaafir for them Amidst these warnings one popular strand of messaging launches stinging attacks on the Congress using disinformation and outright manufactured facts One for instance found on both WhatsApp and Facebook insists that the nation should after the IsraelHamas war be grateful to Nathuram Godse the man who killed Mahatma Gandhi If not for him India would have had a 3000kilometre long Gaza patti strip across the country it says while being accompanied by an image the Indian subcontinent showing a green corridor cutting through India connecting Pakistan and Bangladesh erstwhile East Pakistan These messages disparagingly call Gandhi Ganduji and claim that he had accepted this proposal by Jinnah for such a corridor Howeverfactchecking sites have repeatedly debunked claims that Gandhi accepted such a proposal Many messages blame the Congress for these attacks by Hamas and claim that former PM Rajiv Gandhi had given Yasser Arafat the chief of the Palestine Liberation Organisation a peace prize This was a lie Arafat received the Indira Gandhi Award For International Justice and Harmony award in New Delhi but this was given to him by the Indian Council of World Affairs The award in fact was given in January 1992 while Gandhi had been assassinated in May 1991 VP Singh was the prime minister during the time of the ceremony and the government was incidentally supported by the BJP But the messages make no mention of this Delegitimise support for Palestine Most of these groups are full of videos and photos purportedly of the war showing the civilian casualties of the war except they are almost exclusively meant to show the sufferings of Israelis while mocking at the sufferings of Palestinians These groups joke about how Palestinians conflated with terrorists were going to be rewarded with hoors beautiful girls when they go to heaven after their deaths Another viral image across many of these groups is a badlydamaged structure in ruins which resembles a stairway going nowhere The groups quoting the image express glee at how Palestinians were now directly going to gain entry into jannat heaven This constant dehumanising of their sufferings then also extends to expressing support towards them In constant messages and memes those backing Palestinians are described as snakes No shortage of snakes in India one message describes protests against Israeli air strikes targeting civilians I am just in the way A very frequent presence across these groups is of the prime minister Narendra Modi A popular common message across groups was an image of a grim Modi staring straight back and asking readers to realise whats happening in Israel can happen in Bharat The message serves both as a warning for Hindus and as an endorsement of Modi The attack is imminent and Modi is the only person who can save Hindus from such an attack In reality they are not after me they are after you I am just in the way reads a caption around Modis photo Another viral piece of propaganda has photos of Modi home minister Amit Shah and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval asking people to be grateful before you sleep tonight to these three for keeping India safe It does not make mention of any terror attacks that occurred during the last nine years Such endorsements of Modi go handinhand with messages stoking hate and anger against Muslims A video featuring Modi is repeatedly circulated across these groups In the video undated Modi is seen talking about Muslims They have divided the world into three parts Modi says going on to talk about Dar alAman Dar alHarab and Dar alIslam which he explains as land of peace land of conflict and the third being to convert the whole world into Islam This video is accompanied by the same caption in all these groups I will vote for Modi 100 times for a Safe India what ever may come in the way He explained this before 20 years sic Similar messages while warning of an impending Islamic attack on India pitch Modi as the perfect counter for this Messages ask supporters to forget about concerns like cheap petrol and free ration warning that there were countless traitors inside the country It asks readers to remember the plight of Ukrainians Without naming Modi these messages ask voters to vote for a STRONG LEADER Kunal Purohit is an independent journalist writing on politics gender development migration and the intersections between them Shiv Sena UBT MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday said Eknath Shinde himself is Hamas as he countered the Maharashtra chief ministers comment about Uddhav Thackerays Shiv Sena faction being capable of joining hands with Hamas and LashkareTaiba for their own selfishness Taking a jibe at Shinde Raut said He himself is Hamas These terrorist organisations Hamas and LashkareTaiba hold no significance in Maharashtra But its the BJP that has filled worms in their Shinde factions minds Raut added advertisement Raut was responding to Shindes statement made at the Dussehra rally in Mumbais Azad Maidan on Tuesday For their own selfishness they will tie the knot with Hamas and LashkareTaiba Shinde said while referring to Uddhav Thackerays Shiv Sena UBTs alliance with Congress and the Samajwadi Party as part of the opposition alliance INDIA Raut pointed out that Shindes speech was about the BJP unlike the Dussehra rallies held by the Shiv Sena every year I can say a lot of things but we have the values of Balasaheb Thackeray ji Balasaheb Thackeray used to talk about the country and the people But his Shindes entire speech was about strengthening the BJP strengthening Modi ji strengthening JP Nadda ji he said It was Dussehra yesterday an auspicious day We should talk about auspicious things But you are talking about these things He Shinde is Hamas Al Qaeda of Maharashtra He betrayed the Shiv Seva that gave birth to him in politics promoted him till he became the chief minister Raut added Shinde in his Dussehra speech also questioned Shiv Sena UBTs alliance formed with Akhilesh Yadavs Samajwadi Party that he claimed had resorted to using bullets against karsevaks The reference was to a 1990 incident when Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav had instructed police officials to open fire on karsevaks in Ayodhya aiming to deter them from advancing towards the Babri Masjid Thackeray and Shinde leaders of the split factions of the Shiv Sena organized separate Dussehra rallies this year in Mumbai for the first time in the history of the party Edited By Aishwarya Dakhore Published On Oct 25 2023 Chinese President Xi Jinping recently sought to assure a bipartisan delegation of US senators that China and the United States could still avoid a military confrontation despite the rising tensions between them The Thucydides Trap he said is not inevitable The term Thucydides Trap a reference to the ancient Greek historians account of the Peloponnesian War was coined by political scientist Graham Allison to describe the seemingly unavoidable conflict that arises when an emerging power such as China challenges an established hegemon like the United States Allison argued that China will eventually overtake the US as the worlds largest economy a notion bolstered by Chinese government economists who predict that the countrys GDP will be twice as large as Americas by 2030 and three times as large by 2049 Such forecasts have fueled strategic anxiety among many US politicians and scholars wary of Chinas growing economic clout and geopolitical aspirations Allisons thesis seems to have found a receptive audience within Chinese leadership circles In fact the Chinese economys explosive growth  GDP has skyrocketed to 76 of comparable US GDP in 2021 from 7 in 1990  has evidently convinced policymakers in both China and the US that the Thucydides Trap is indeed inevitable But to borrow again from ancient Greece these predictions fail to account for Chinas Achilles heel its bleak demographic outlook An aging population can hinder production reduce consumption stifle innovation undermine public morale and erode economic vitality In the 2007 edition of my book Big Country with an Empty Nest I likened Chinas demographic trajectory to a sprinter  quick but lacking stamina By comparison both the US and India are marathon runners poised to dominate the 21st century Japan which I likened to a middledistance runner provides a cautionary tale With a rapidly growing workforce and a young population Japans GDP soared from 8 of Americas in 1960 to 73 by 1995 In 1994 however its primeage labor force 1559 began to decline and it has since trailed the US by every demographic measure Japans economic growth rate has been lower than Americas since 1992 and its GDP has fallen to a mere 16 that of the US in 2023  Italys experience underscores the danger of ignoring demographic shifts  Italys experience underscores the danger of ignoring demographic shifts The countrys prime workingage labor force has been shrinking since 1993 and its population is significantly older than that of the US Consequently its GDP has dropped from 20 of Americas in 1992 to 8 this year Chinas population aged more rapidly than previously predicted and its fertility rate births per woman has been lower than that of the US since 1991 and below those of Japan and Italy since 2021 Chinas primeage labor force began to shrink in 2012 signaling the end of its threedecade run of doubledigit GDP growth In the decade since then the gap between the Chinese and US economies continued to narrow partly owing to Chinas massive housing bubble But by 203135 China will lag behind the US in every demographic metric and its GDP growth rate will likely fall below Americas Chinese GDP has fallen from 76 of Americas in 2021 to 66 in 2023 While this decline is likely the result of shortterm fluctuations it could foreshadow a widening economic divide between a rapidly aging China and a largely middleaged US Read Americas getting older  and actually thats good news for the stock market Americas demographic advantages have played a crucial role in maintaining its global dominance Its postWorld War II baby boom for example exceeded Europes Moreover the US experienced a second baby boom from the late 1970s to the mid2000s as its fertility rate increased to 21 in 1990 from 174 in 1976 and remaining stable until 2007 Over the same period the European Unions fertility rate fell to 152 from 206 By 2008 the median age in the EU was four years higher than in the US Moreover while the EUs primeage labor force began to decline in 2008 Americas workforce is expected to remain steady until 2048 Unsurprisingly EU GDP which was 11 times that of the US in 2008 has fallen to 68 of the US level in 2023  The US often struggles to address its demographic challenges effectively  But the US has its own reasons for concern Americas fertility rate fell to 167 in 2022 from 212 in 2007 and is expected to decline further as more women delay marriage and childbirth and as male laborforce participation declines Moreover the US often struggles to address its demographic challenges effectively Despite spending more on health care than any other country the US has the shortest life expectancy in the developed world Alarmingly one in 25 American fiveyearolds today will die before their 40th birthday with drug overdoses and gun violence among the leading causes These demographic shifts could lead to an economic slowdown undermine political cohesion and even endanger American democracy Both China and the US have entered a period of economic and political turmoil characterized by strategic anxiety and heightened risk of miscalculation Both also seem to downplay the severity of their respective demographic crises Left unaddressed Chinas demographic trap could precipitate a civilizational collapse Meanwhile the US could find its global influence diminished Whereas it once singlehandedly shaped the international order its ability to preserve global stability now hinges on the cooperation of its allies and engagement with China Given the demographic challenges facing both countries however the anticipated Thucydidean clash of titans might ultimately resemble a schoolyard scuffle Yi Fuxian a senior scientist in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of WisconsinMadison is the author of Big Country with an Empty Nest

worst tragedy Congress MP Shashi Tharoor alleged that Israels response to the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack was disproportionate as a greater number of Palestinian people were killed in the past 19 days compared to those who lost their lives in the region since the year 2008 Addressing an event organised to express solidarity with the Palestine people by the Indian United Muslim League IUML in Keralas Kozhikode on Thursday Tharoor urged Israel to end air strikes in Gaza adding that India has always stood for peace since Mahatama Gandhi Since 19 days the world is seeing the worst humanrights tragedies We are seeing the worst tragedy Terrorists attacked Israel Hamas is a terror group Israel stopped providing food water and electricity to Gaza We are condemning the bombing of Israel Tharoor said at the event held at Kozhikode beach Tharoor who had previoulsy served as an UN diplomat said the ongoing air strikes in Gaza by Israel in response to the Hamas attack was disproportionate Reiterating Bapus words Tharoor said An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind India has always stood for peace since Gandhi He also highlighted that the ongoing crisis is not a Muslim issue but a human rights issue and said war knows no religion Israel calls their operation Swords of Iron but now those swords are dipped in the blood of children The bombing has caused a lot of injuries and innocent people are suffering and they are dying Many are living under suffocating occupation Tharoor said He said that over 6000 Palestinians and 300 Isrealis were killed in clashes in the area between 2008 and September this year and the number of those who died since October 7 however was much more While 1400 Israelis died in the Hamas terrorist attack many more were killed in Gaza when Israel responded to itInnocent civilians are dying Tharoor said Tharoor urged Israel to end the war and further appealed to the world to unite to end the human rights violations inflicted on the Palestinian people Now it is more than time to announce a ceasefire the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram said While addressing the rally IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty said that the biggest weapon in the world is public opinion and that showing solidarity will bring results Children are dying We all are here to shed tears for the brutality in Gaza We have no weapons to send there or save them This rally will yield fruit because the biggest weapon in the world is public opinion Global leaders are joining in solidarity Thats how we also joined this Solidarity has made results here Killings should stop in Palestine he said IUML Party workers gathered in strength for Thursdays rally which was presided over by Kunhalikutty with Shashi Tharoor as Chief Guest IUML state president Panakkad Sayyid Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal inaugurated the rally In his speech Thangal said Israels occupation has created Palestine conflict They are trying to survive They are trying the defend their land Stop genocide killings This conflict has started since 1947 Gandhi criticised Israeli occupation Nehru Manmohan Singh even Vajpayee also took a stand against the Israeli occupation of Palestine They all stood with justice The current government is trying to dilute that stand and make Israel look holy They are trying to whitewash Israel We should stand with marginalised Indias policy is to support the vulnerable people Israel is the biggest terrorist country Whoever is supporting Israel they are supporting terror Justice will rise over there thats why we are having this rally With our prayers let their wounds be healed the IUML leader said On attending the IUMLs solidarity rally Tharoor said India is one of the handful of countries that maintains ambassadors in both Israel and Palestine and enjoys good relations with both We should be a voice for peace amid the carnage After the October 7 attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip by Hamas Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set up a war cabinet and the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said they will launch a ground offensive on Gaza seeking to wipe off from the face of earth the Palestineterror group ANI  October 27 2023 0216 pm  Updated 0341 pm IST  Thiruvananthapuram Congress Working Committee CWC member Shashi Tharoor MP appeared to have put his party in an awkward spot by purportedly referring to Hamas as a terrorist organisation at the mammoth rally organised by the Indian Union Muslim League IUML in Kozhikode on October 26 2023 to proclaim solidarity with the Palestine cause Congress leadership in Kerala was yet to react to the contentious usage which drew onstage criticism from IUML leaders MK Muneer MLA and MP Abdussamad Samadani Both termed their opposition to Israels expansionist policies in Gaza and the West Bank as legitimate resistance IUML is a staunch Congress ally and a prominent constituent in the United Democratic Front UDF Opposition in Kerala Speech cherrypicked On October 27 Friday Mr Tharoor denied the imputation He said some quarters had cherrypicked his speech to inject parochial politics into a global humanitarian cause He said the address was solidly and unequivocally proPalestine when viewed in its entirety IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty MLA sought to end the row He welcomed Mr Tharoors clarification and said provincial politics had no bearing on the IUMLs decision to rally public opinion in favour of Palestines oppressed starved and terrorised people He said the IUML had invited Mr Tharoor as the chief guest to the rally in recognition of his global experience and international stature The IUML would defeat efforts to rob the proPalestine rallys relevance political message and sheen Communist Party of India Marxist CPIM State secretariat member M Swaraj was bitingly critical of Mr Tharoors speech In a Facebook post Mr Swaraj alleged that Mr Tharoor had used the IUMLs public platform to relay his solidarity with Israel Mr Tharoor appeared to imply somewhat reductively that the incendiary Palestine problem had its genesis in Hamass attack on Israel on October 7 And the current genocidal attacks on the besieged people of Palestine were Israels legitimate response Mr Tharoor seemed pointedly disinclined to term Israel a terrorist nation wrote Mr Swaraj Left independent legislator and a sharp critic of the IUML KT Jaleel MLA said the IUML rally seemed to express solidarity with expansionist and imperialistic Israel and its backers instead of solidly rallying behind the tyrannised and terrorised people of Palestine CPIM State secretary M V Govindan seemed to take a relatively softer line given the partys outreach to minority communities to whittle the electoral prospects of the rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and its empathy towards the antiBJP INDIA bloc opposition partnership Mr Govindan seemed reluctant to confront Mr Tharoor by stating that the Congress leader had explained Mr Govindan also seemed to pussyfoot around whether the party viewed Hamas as a terrorist outfit He merely said the CPIM stance on the Palestine question was clear Last week Mr Govindan had fielded the same question by stating that he would not elaborate on Hamass class nature I am not going to elaborate on the class nature of Hamas The CPIM is concerned about the rights of the Palestinian people Communists reckon them as an oppressed class and exiles in their land A hostile Israel has hedged in Palestine from three sides Palestinians have only the sea to flee to Mr Govindan had said Suresh Gopis support Mr Tharoor found some support in BJP leader Suresh Gopi who termed Hamas a terrorist organisation inimical to the welfare of Palestinians Mr Tharoor would not make an offthecuff statement Mr Gopi said BJP State president K Surendran appeared to take a harsher line against Mr Tharoor and the IUML He called the rally an open display of support for Hamas a terrorist outfit that massacred Israeli civilians Mr Tharoor had no business attending the rally that went against the grain of Indias stance on the issue in the United Nations Mr Surendran said India News Updates 741 crore returns have been filed for Assessment Year 202324 till date including 53 lakh new first time filers Income Tax Department The IT department also

stopped providing food water and electricity to Gaza We are condemning the bombing of Israel Tharoor said at the event held at Kozhikode beach Tharoor who had previoulsy served as an UN diplomat said the ongoing air strikes in Gaza by Israel in response to the Hamas attack was disproportionate Reiterating Bapus words Tharoor said An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind India has always stood for peace since Gandhi He also highlighted that the ongoing crisis is not a Muslim issue but a human rights issue and said war knows no religion Israel calls their operation Swords of Iron but now those swords are dipped in the blood of children The bombing has caused a lot of injuries and innocent people are suffering and they are dying Many are living under suffocating occupation Tharoor said He said that over 6000 Palestinians and 300 Isrealis were killed in clashes in the area between 2008 and September this year and the number of those who died since October 7 however was much more While 1400 Israelis died in the Hamas terrorist attack many more were killed in Gaza when Israel responded to itInnocent civilians are dying Tharoor said Tharoor urged Israel to end the war and further appealed to the world to unite to end the human rights violations inflicted on the Palestinian people Now it is more than time to announce a ceasefire the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram said While addressing the rally IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty said that the biggest weapon in the world is public opinion and that showing solidarity will bring results Children are dying We all are here to shed tears for the brutality in Gaza We have no weapons to send there or save them This rally will yield fruit because the biggest weapon in the world is public opinion Global leaders are joining in solidarity Thats how we also joined this Solidarity has made results here Killings should stop in Palestine he said IUML Party workers gathered in strength for Thursdays rally which was presided over by Kunhalikutty with Shashi Tharoor as Chief Guest IUML state president Panakkad Sayyid Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal inaugurated the rally In his speech Thangal said Israels occupation has created Palestine conflict They are trying to survive They are trying the defend their land Stop genocide killings This conflict has started since 1947 Gandhi criticised Israeli occupation Nehru Manmohan Singh even Vajpayee also took a stand against the Israeli occupation of Palestine They all stood with justice The current government is trying to dilute that stand and make Israel look holy They are trying to whitewash Israel We should stand with marginalised Indias policy is to support the vulnerable people Israel is the biggest terrorist country Whoever is supporting Israel they are supporting terror Justice will rise over there thats why we are having this rally With our prayers let their wounds be healed the IUML leader said On attending the IUMLs solidarity rally Tharoor said India is one of the handful of countries that maintains ambassadors in both Israel and Palestine and enjoys good relations with both We should be a voice for peace amid the carnage After the October 7 attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip by Hamas Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set up a war cabinet and the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said they will launch a ground offensive on Gaza seeking to wipe off from the face of earth the Palestineterror group ANI  October 26 2023 0815 pm  Updated 0838 pm IST  Kozhikode Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal Indian Union Muslim League IUML State president has called Israel a terrorist nation for its massacre of the hapless Palestinian people in Gaza in the wake of the Hamas attack on October 7 He was opening an event organised by the IUML on the Kozhikode beach on Thursday to extend support to Palestine The Thangal said the Palestinian people had been resisting the invasion attempts by Israel since 1947 Their land properties everything is being taken over and they are displaced from their land Resistance has been their oxygen for long A wellknown Palestinian poet has described his people as dead bodies that breathe he said The IUML leader pointed out that India had been supporting them after realising Israels hidden agenda of invasion People like Mahatma Gandhi father of our nation have criticised the invasion Prime Ministers from Nehru to Manmohan Singh continued that line Even Atal Bihari Vajpayee was supporting Palestine The current dispensation at the Centre however has diluted our position and is seen whitewashing Israel It is condemnable he said Terming Israel the biggest terrorist nation in the world the Thangal said countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom were found to be supporting it These Western nations which always talk about human rights were turning a blind eye towards what was happening in Gaza A free Palestine is the only solution for which political talks should be held Israel should stop its terrorist activities and fall in line he added Thousands of people including a large number of women from across northern Kerala districts gathered on the beach to attend the event which also proved to be a show of strength of the IUML ahead of the Lok Sabha polls The partys elected representatives including MPs and MLAs were present October 26 2023 0721 pm  Updated October 27 2023 1101 am IST  Kozhikode Shashi Tharoor MP and Congress Working Committee member has alleged that Israels response to the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7 is disproportionate as more number of Palestinian people have been killed in the past 19 days when compared with those who lost their lives in skirmishes in the region since 2008 He was delivering a keynote address at an event organised by the Indian Union Muslim League on the Kozhikode beach on Thursday to express solidarity with the Palestinian people Mr Tharoor said quoting the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs that as many as 6407 Palestinians and 300 Israelis died in the clashes in the region between 2008 and September this year The number of those who died since October 7 however was much more While 1400 Israelis died in the Hamas terrorist attack many more were killed in Gaza when Israel responded to it The response is continuing too At the same time a total of 101 Palestinians and one Israeli are dead in West Bank which is an occupied area In Lebanon 52 Palestinians and four Israelis have died he said Israel has termed its attack Operation Sword of Iron Before this war ends that sword will have to be dipped in the blood of how many children we dont know Mr Tharoor said The Congress leader also accused Israel of violating international agreements on war such as the Geneva Convention while pounding Gaza He said hapless children and women were getting killed and religious places of worship including an Orthodox church over 1000 years old were destroyed The UN relief agency had said it was left with no or little fuel Hospitals are facing difficulties while attending to the wounded There is no clean water power petrol or diesel Israel is allowing very few trucks from Egypt carrying essentials to enter Gaza Mr Tharoor said He ended his speech calling for a ceasefire by Israel and quoted the late Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish The war will end the leaders will shake hands the old woman will keep waiting for her martyred son That girl will wait for her beloved husband And those children will wait for their hero father I dont know who sold our homeland But I saw who paid the price']\n"
