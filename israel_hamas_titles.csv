Israel shelling kills two in south Lebanon,2023-01-12,"BEIRUT/JERUSALEM - Israeli shelling killed two people in south Lebanon on Friday, a Lebanese official said, as the collapse of a truce between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas prompted a resumption of hostilities at the frontier.

The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, said it had carried out several attacks on Israeli military positions at the border in support Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where a week long pause in the fighting ended early on Friday.

The Israeli army said its artillery struck sources of fire from Lebanon and air defences had intercepted two launches. The army also said it struck a ""terrorist cell"". Sirens warning of possible incoming rockets sounded in several towns in northern Israel, sending residents running for shelter.

Israeli shelling killed a woman and her 35-year-old son in the Lebanese border town of Houla, Shakeeb Koteich, the head of the town's municipal council, told Reuters, saying both were civilians.

""A shell landed near the house, and then a second one hit the house,"" Koteich said by telephone.

Following the eruption of the Hamas-Israel war on Oct. 7, Hezbollah mounted near daily rocket attacks on Israeli positions at the frontier while Israel waged air and artillery strikes in south Lebanon.

It has been the worst fighting since a 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, part of an Iran-backed alliance that also includes Hamas. About 100 people in Lebanon have been killed during the hostilities, 80 of them Hezbollah fighters. Tens of thousands of people have fled both sides of the border.

Hezbollah released statements claiming five attacks on Israeli military positions at the border, describing these as ""in support of our steadfast Palestinian people ... and its valiant and honourable resistance"".

Lebanon-based militants from Hamas and the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad have also mounted attacks from Lebanese territory.

""Hezbollah has linked what happens at the border with what happens in Gaza,"" said Nabil Boumonsef, deputy editor-in-chief of Lebanon's Annahar newspaper.

""All the while the war in Gaza continues Lebanon will remain threatened by the danger of a major escalation.""

Senior Hezbollah politician Hassan Fadlallah earlier said the group was vigilant and ready after the Hamas-Israel truce ended.

""In Lebanon, we are concerned in facing this challenge, being vigilant, and always ready to confront any possibility and any danger that may arise in our country,"" he said.

""No one thinks that Lebanon has been spared from this Zionist targeting or that what is happening in Gaza cannot affect the situation in Lebanon,"" he said.",https://www.middle-east-online.com/,-1
"Israeli war planes, artillery bombard southern Gaza",2023-02-12,"GAZA/CAIRO - US Vice President Kamala Harris said too many innocent Palestinians had been killed in Gaza as Israeli war planes and artillery bombarded the enclave on Saturday following the collapse of a truce with Hamas militants.

Residents feared the barrages presaged an Israeli ground operation in the south of the Palestinian territory that would pen them into a shrinking area and possibly try to push them across into Egypt.

The Gaza health ministry said at least 193 Palestinians had been killed since the truce ended on Friday, adding to the more than 15,000 Palestinian dead since the start of the war. Israel has sworn to annihilate Hamas following its Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel in which it says 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage.

Speaking in Dubai, Harris said Israel had a right to defend itself, but international and humanitarian law must be respected and ""too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.""

""Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering, and the images and videos coming from Gaza, are devastating,"" Harris told reporters.

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also weighed in on the need for Israel to protect Gaza civilians as a ""moral responsibility"" even as he said the US would remain its closest friend. ""The center of gravity is the civilian population,"" he said. ""And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.""

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was continuing to work in coordination with the US and international organisations to define ""safe areas"" for Gaza civilians.

""This is important because we have no desire to harm the population,"" Netanyahu told a news conference in Tel Aviv. ""We have a very strong desire to hurt Hamas.""

Harris also sketched out a US vision for post-conflict Gaza, saying the international community must support recovery and Palestinian security forces must be strengthened.

""We want to see a unified Gaza and West Bank under the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian voices and aspirations must be at the center of this work,"" she said, adding that Hamas must no longer run Gaza.

The Western-backed Palestinian Authority governs parts of the occupied West Bank. Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' mainstream Fatah party and has ruled the enclave ever since.

Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas once and for all. The Iranian-backed Islamist group is sworn to Israel’s destruction. One of its officials has said Hamas would repeat the Oct. 7 attacks if possible.

The Israeli military said it had killed Wessam Farhat, commander of a Hamas battalion who sent fighters to hit two kibbutzim near the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7. It also described him as one of the planners of the raid.

ISRAEL SEEKS 'SECURITY ENVELOPE'

Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, said Israel did not want to see Gaza's civilians caught in the crossfire.

""Israel is targeting Hamas, a brutal terrorist organization that has committed the most horrific violence against innocent civilians. Israel is making a maximum effort to safeguard Gaza's civilians,"" Regev said.

He said that when the war was over, Israel would seek a ""security envelope"" with special zones and arrangements to prevent Hamas from being positioned on its border.

Throughout Saturday morning, a steady stream of wounded people were carried into the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Gaza health officials said 650 had been wounded since the truce collapsed.

The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross said the renewed fighting was intense.

""It's a new layer of destruction coming on top of massive, unparalleled destruction,"" Robert Mardini told Reuters in Dubai.

With conditions inside Gaza reaching ""breaking point,"" in Mardini's words, the first aid trucks since the end of the truce entered from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, Egyptian security and Red Crescent sources said. Some 100 trucks passed through, carrying food, water and medical supplies, the sources said.

A senior official said Israel would facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza's civilians.

The warring sides blamed each other for the collapse of the seven-day truce, during which Hamas had released hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.

Israel said it had recalled a team from Qatar, host of indirect negotiations with Hamas, accusing the Palestinian faction of reneging on a deal to free all the women and children it was holding.

French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said he was heading to Qatar to work on a new truce.

The deputy head of Hamas, however, said no prisoners would be exchanged with Israel unless there is a ceasefire and all Palestinian detainees in Israel are released.

Saleh Al-Arouri told Al Jazeera TV that Israeli hostages held by Hamas are soldiers and civilian men who previously served in the army.

But Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas breached its commitment to free 17 women and children still held in Gaza and insisted that the militant group must keep its word.

SOUTH TARGETED

The southern part of Gaza including Khan Younis and Rafah was pounded on Saturday. Residents said houses and a school had been hit and three mosques destroyed in Khan Younis. Columns of smoke rose into the sky.

Hamas said it targeted Tel Aviv with a rocket barrage. There were no reports of damage but paramedics said one man was treated for a shrapnel injury in central Israel.

Displaced Gazans have been sheltering in Khan Younis and Rafah because of fighting in the north, but residents said they feared Israeli troops were preparing to move south.

Palestinian witnesses said Israeli tanks had taken up positions near the road between Khan Younis and Deir Al-Balah.

Yamen, who gave only his first name, fled to Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza from the north after Israel destroyed several districts there.

""Where to after Deir Al-Balah, after Khan Younis? I don't know where I would take my wife and six children.""

On Saturday morning, Israeli air strikes hit areas close to the Nasser Hospital six times, medics and witnesses said.

The hospital is filled with thousands of displaced and hundreds of wounded, including many of those who had been evacuated from north Gaza hospitals.

""A night of horror,"" said Samira, a mother of four. ""It was one of the worst nights we spent in Khan Younis in the past six weeks since we arrived here ... We are so afraid they will enter Khan Younis.""",https://www.middle-east-online.com/,-1
Israel Retrieves Bodies Of Two Abducted Soldiers,2023-02-20,"Israeli forces recovered the bodies of two abducted soldiers, the Israel Defense Forces announced on Friday morning.

The bodies of Cpl Nik Beizer and Sgt Ron Sherman were positively identified by medical officials and military rabbis, together with the Institute of Forensic Medicine and the Israel Police.

Beizer, a 19-year-old resident of Beersheva, was a driver for the Erez District Coordination Office, which is a liaison between Israel and the Palestinians. Beizer was last seen on October 7 in the area of the Erez Crossing between Israel and Gaza.

Sherman, a 19-year-old from the Negev town of Lehavim, was a non-commissioned officer in the Gaza Coordination and Liaison Administration. He was a dual Israeli-Argentine national.

Earlier in the morning, the IDF announced it had recovered the body of Elia Toledano. The 28-year-old was abducted from the Supernova music festival.

The IDF announcements did not indicate how or when Beizer, Sherman or Toledano died.

“Our national mission is to locate the missing and return all the hostages home. We are working together with security agencies and with all intelligence and operational means in order to return all of the hostages home,” the IDF said.

OIC Condemns the Israeli Occupation for Allowing Extremists to March into the Occupied City of Al-Quds and the Continued Israeli Aggression against the Palestinian People,2023-07-12,"OIC Condemns the Israeli Occupation for Allowing Extremists to March into the Occupied City of Al-Quds and the Continued Israeli Aggression against the Palestinian People

Date: 07/12/2023

The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) condemned the Israeli occupation for permitting extremist settler groups to stage a provocative march through the old neighborhoods of the occupied city of Al-Quds, as part of illegal and rejected attempts aimed at impinging on the existing historical and legal status of the Islamic and Christian holy sites in Al-Quds, especially the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque.

The OIC also warned of the danger of the continued Judaization plans carried out by the Israeli occupation authorities in the city, including the so-called “lower canal” plan, which is proposing the construction of approximately 1,792 colonial units in a new colonial bloc in the eastern part of the city, within the framework of the rejected and condemned attempts to change the existing historical, political, legal and demographic status of the city, Judaizing and severing it from its Palestinian surroundings.

The OIC reaffirmed that the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif, the capital of the State of Palestine, is an integral part of the Palestinian territory occupied in 1967. The OIC also rejected any measures or decisions aimed at imposing the alleged Israeli sovereignty over the city and its sanctities, as illegal and illegitimate under international law and relevant UN resolutions.

Furthermore, the OIC renewed its call on international actors, especially the UN Security Council, to shoulder their responsibilities to stop the ongoing Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, which led to the killing of more than 16,000 martyrs, the coercive displacement of more than 1.8 million Palestinian citizens from their homes, and the lack of shelter centers in light of the prevention of supplies of fuel, electricity, materials, food, medical and drinking water. Most hospitals and medical centers are out of service in the Gaza Strip.

The OIC also called on the international community to assume its responsibilities and exert pressure on Israel, the occupying power, to put an end to the acts of violence and organized terrorism committed by extremist settler groups and Israeli occupation forces across the West Bank, leading to the killing of more than 260 martyrs and the arrest of more than 3,550 Palestinian citizens since the seventh of last October.

Date: 08/12/2023

The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) condemned in the strongest terms the horrific crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces in the Al-Far’a camp near the city of Tubas, killing six martyrs and wounding others. It considered that an extension of the war crimes and genocide committed by the Israeli occupation and settler groups in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including The Holy City of Al-Quds.

The OIC held Israel, the occupying power, responsible for the continuation of these crimes. It called, at the same time, on the international community, especially Member States of the UN Security Council, to assume their responsibilities and vote on 8 December 2023 for the draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire, protecting Palestinian civilians, and ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid, and the urgent needs of the Gaza Strip, based on Article 99 of the UN Charter and international humanitarian law.

Fragile Global Economy Faces New Crisis in Israel-Gaza War,2023-10-10,"The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that the pace of the global economic recovery is slowing, a warning that came as a new war in the Middle East threatened to upend a world economy already reeling from several years of overlapping crises.

The eruption of fighting between Israel and Hamas over the weekend, which could sow disruption across the region, reflects how challenging it has become to shield economies from increasingly frequent and unpredictable global shocks. The conflict has cast a cloud over a gathering of top economic policymakers in Morocco for the annual meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank.

Officials who planned to grapple with the lingering economic effects of the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine now face a new crisis.

“Economies are at a delicate state,” Ajay Banga, the World Bank president, said in an interview on the sidelines of the annual meetings. “Having war is really not helpful for central banks who are finally trying to find their way to a soft landing,” he said. Mr. Banga was referring to efforts by policymakers in the West to try to cool rapid inflation without triggering a recession.",https://www.nytimes.com/,-1
Oil prices surge above $90 a barrel after Israel orders mass evacuations,2023-10-12,"Listen 5 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

Oil prices surged Friday amid growing geopolitical tensions, as violence in Israel continued to stoke concerns of a broader regional conflict. Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed 5.5 percent to nearly $91 per barrel by midafternoon. The U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude, added 5.5 percent to nearly $88 per barrel.

The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that it would “continue to operate significantly” in the northern Gaza Strip as it gave the region’s 1.1 million people a 24-hour deadline to evacuate. Israeli strikes are pounding the densely populated enclave, and troops are massing nearby ahead of an anticipated ground incursion following Hamas militants’ staged an unprecedented attack on Oct. 7

Turmoil in Middle East makes markets skittish; the region accounts for more than a third of the world’s seaborne oil trade, according to International Energy Agency. While there has been no direct impact on physical supply, “the oil market — like all markets — routinely acts based on emotion rather than logic,” said Pavel Molchanov, managing director and equity research analyst at Raymond James.

“The headlines surrounding this war are creating some extra volatility in oil prices — this is a matter of market psychology, pure and simple,” he said in an email Friday.

Oil prices have been gyrating for days. On Thursday, the Treasury Department sanctioned two shipping companies for violating a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian crude, marking the first penalties intended to enforce what experts say is a widely flouted rule.

The price cap was initiated in December 2022 with the intent of starving the Russian economy and war machine of oil revenue amid President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. It is backed by a coalition that includes the Group of Seven nations — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — as well as the European Union.

The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) is imposing penalties against Ice Pearl Navigation Corp., a Turkish shipping company, for transporting Russian crude priced above $80 per barrel. It also sanctioned Lumber Marine, a shipping company based in the United Arab Emirates.

Treasury spokeswoman Megan Apper said enforcement is central to the administration’s effort to limit Russia’s profits from its oil trade, noting that the price cap is designed to keep Russian oil flowing while imposing new costs on Russia, and not to reduce oil supply.

“Indeed, oil prices fell in the hours following the announcement … of course, oil prices are sensitive to many factors, including ongoing conflict in the Middle East,” Apper said in an email.

As a result of the move, both companies are “blocked” by the OFAC, prohibiting any U.S. person or entity from paying or trading for their goods or services. Though the agency left open the possibility that the blocks could be lifted. “The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior,” the OFAC wrote in its Thursday release.

Officials cast the sanctions as a warning to other shippers.

“We remain committed to implementing a price cap policy that has two goals: reducing the oil profits upon which Russia relies to wage its unjust war against Ukraine and keeping global energy markets stable and well-supplied despite turbulence caused by Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a release, adding, “We will continue to take actions to achieve these two goals.”

The policy appears to be working in that it has forced Russia to explore more costly ways of getting its oil to buyers, along with paying steeper discounts, says Bob McNally, a consultant with Rapidan Energy Group. But rising oil prices could complicate the G7’s plans, he said, because they want to prevent a sharp drop in exports of Russian oil, something that could lead to supply shortages and higher prices.

“Were oil prices to start rising again I would expect the Treasury to dial back on enforcement stringency,” McNally said Thursday. “The main goal remains to keep Russian exports up in order to keep domestic gasoline prices down.”

On Friday, the U.S. average for a galloon of gas stood at $3.63, according to AAA, down 28 cents from a year ago.

Other entities are known to have carried Russian oil priced above the cap, the Treasury Department said. McNally said it’s likely that other companies are violating the price cap, although it’s not clear how many. About 70 percent of Russian exports appear to be using non-G7 transportation services ― which wouldn’t violate the rule. “As for how much of the [remaining] 30 percent might be in violation, we don’t have a strong sense … though the temptation must be there,” he said.

The sanctions against Ice Pearl are related to an April 17 notice stating that OFAC is aware of reports that Eastern Siberia Pacific Ocean (ESPO) oil, which originates from Pacific ports in Russia, was trading over the price cap. The Treasury Department’s news release on Thursday stated that the Yasa Golden Bosphorus, owned by Ice Pearl, had carried ESPO oil priced above $80 per barrel after the cap was imposed.

Lumber Marine is accused of carrying oil priced above $75 per barrel on a ship called the SCF Primorye, a crude-oil tanker registered in Liberia that took oil from Novy Port in a northern section of Russia.

"Iranian FM says Hamas Attack a ""Natural Reaction"" of Palestinians",2023-10-16,"Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has defended the Hamas militant group's attack as the ""natural reaction"" of the Palestinians against the Israeli government.

Amir-Abdollahian met the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and other senior members of the group in Qatar, on October 14, to discuss the Israel-Gaza war, according to the Iranian Foreign Ministry website.

The Iranian foreign minister congratulated Haniyeh on the ""victories of the Palestinian people's resistance,"" and added that “the Al-Aqsa operation was the Palestinian nation’s natural reaction to the relentless crimes and provocative moves by the extremist government of Netanyahu”.

“If the Israeli regime’s crimes in Gaza continue, any possibility in the region is likely, and the Islamic Republic of Iran will continue its attempts to halt Israeli war crimes,” he noted.

In turn, Haniyeh expressed his gratitude to Iran for supporting Palestine, saying that the Muslim world is expected to lend its strong support to the Palestinian nation.

He said that the Al-Aqsa Flood operation was a natural reaction to numerous crimes against the oppressed Palestinian nation in recent months.

Amir-Abdollahian arrived in Qatar on October 14, after visiting Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. He met Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who also the Foreign Minister. On the following day, he met Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to discuss regional matters ""focusing on Palestine"".

In a phone conversation with the Qatari Emir, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called for ""the war crimes and genocide machine of this regime to be stopped"" and condemned Israel's blockade of Gaza as the ""revenge against defenceless people for its humiliating and historic defeat"".

The Iranian president praised the ""new generation"" of Palestinians for ""rising up for their rights more seriously than ever"", and accused the US and other supporters of Israel of being ""directly responsible for the crimes of this regime"".

On October 14, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expressed hope that the Israel-Gaza war “will progress and lead to the complete victory of the Palestinians"".

Khamenei referred to the Israel-Gaza conflict as ""one of the manifestations of Islam's power"" and called for all-out support by the Muslim world for Palestinians.

The Iranian high-ranking officials have hailed Palestinian militant group Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel on October 7, but they have repeatedly denied any involvement in the offensive.

On October 15, the military wing of the Palestinian group Hamas, the Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for fresh rocket attacks against targets in northern Israel.

Hamas said in a post on Telegram that it launched 20 rockets against the Israeli frontier town of Shlomi and the coastal town of Nahariya.

On the same day, Lebanon’s Iran-backed group Hezbollah said in a statement that its forces launched strikes against northern Israel in response to the killing of a Reuters journalist, Issam Abdullah and two other citizens on October 13 and 14.

The Israeli army’s helicopters attacked Hezbollah's military infrastructure in Lebanon in response to the nine attacks against its forces from Lebanese territory. It happened in a period of escalating tensions last week along the border and UN-demarcated Blue Line, which separates Lebanon and Israel.

According to the Israeli side, the terrorist attack that started the war killed at least 1,400 Israelis and injured over 3,500. At least 150 were taken hostages, many from various nationalities.

Meanwhile, about 2,750 people were killed in the Gaza Strip and more than 9,700 were injured. In the West Bank, 58 people were killed and more than 1,250 were injured, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. In addition, six key Hamas operatives have been eliminated following the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on the Israeli state.

Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran and Israel have been entangled in a proxy conflict. Tehran reportedly provides military and financial support to Hezbollah, as well as Palestinian groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which have engaged in conflicts with Israel.

Opinion | Israel Is About to Make a Terrible Mistake,2023-10-19,"While the president expressed deep understanding of Israel’s moral and strategic dilemma, he pleaded with Israeli military and political leaders to learn from America’s rush to war after Sept. 11, which took our troops deep into the dead ends and dark alleys of unfamiliar cities and towns in Iraq and Afghanistan.

However, from everything I have gleaned from senior U.S. officials, Biden failed to get Israel to hold back and think through all the implications of an invasion of Gaza for Israel and the United States. So let me put this in as stark and clear language as I can, because the hour is late:

I believe that if Israel rushes headlong into Gaza now to destroy Hamas — and does so without expressing a clear commitment to seek a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority and end Jewish settlements deep in the West Bank — it will be making a grave mistake that will be devastating for Israeli interests and American interests.

It could trigger a global conflagration and explode the entire pro-American alliance structure that the United States has built in the region since Henry Kissinger engineered the end of the Yom Kippur War in 1973.

I am talking about the Camp David peace treaty, the Oslo peace accords, the Abraham Accords and the possible normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The whole thing could go up in flames.

This is not about whether Israel has the right to retaliate against Hamas for the savage barbarism it inflicted on Israeli men, women, babies and grandparents. It surely does. This is about doing it the right way — the way that does not play into the hands of Hamas, Iran and Russia.

If Israel goes into Gaza and takes months to kill or capture every Hamas leader and soldier but does so while expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank — thereby making any two-state solution there with the more moderate Palestinian Authority impossible — there will be no legitimate Palestinian or Arab League or European or U.N. or NATO coalition that will ever be prepared to go into Gaza and take it off Israel’s hands.

There will be no one to extract Israel and no one to help Israel pay the cost of caring for more than two million Gazans — not if Israel is run by a government that thinks, and acts, as if it can justifiably exact its revenge on Hamas while unjustifiably building an apartheidlike society run by Jewish supremacists in the West Bank. That is a completely incoherent policy.

Alas, though, a senior U.S. official told me that the Biden team left Jerusalem feeling that while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel understands that overreach in Gaza could set the whole neighborhood ablaze, his right-wing coalition partners are eager to fan the flames in the West Bank. Settlers there have killed at least seven Palestinian civilians in acts of revenge in just the past week.

Meanwhile, U.S. officials told me, the representatives of those settlers in the cabinet are withholding tax money owed the Palestinian Authority, making it harder for it to keep the West Bank as under control as it has been since the start of the Hamas war.

Netanyahu should not allow this, but he has trapped himself. He needs those right-wing extremists in his coalition to keep himself out of jail on corruption charges.

But he is going to put all of Israel into the jail of Gaza unless he breaks with those Jewish supremacists.

Unfortunately, the senior U.S. official told me, Israeli military leaders are actually more hawkish than the prime minister now. They are red with rage and determined to deliver a blow to Hamas that the whole neighborhood will never forget.

I understand why. But friends don’t let friends drive while enraged. Biden has to tell this Israeli government that taking over Gaza without pairing it with a totally new approach to settlements, the West Bank and a two-state solution would be a disaster for Israel and a disaster for America.

We can help, we can even insist, that our Arab and European allies work to create a more effective, less corrupt and more legitimate Palestinian Authority in the West Bank that, after some transition in Gaza, could help govern there as well. But not without a fundamental change in Israeli policy toward the PA and the Jewish settlers.

Otherwise, what began as a Hamas onslaught against Israel has the potential to trigger a Middle East war with every great power and regional power having a hand in it — which would make it very difficult to stop once it started.

In the first week of this conflict, the supreme leader of Iran and Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, appeared to be keeping very tight control of their militiamen on the border with Israel and in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. But as the second week has gone on, U.S. officials have picked up increasing signs that both leaders are letting their forces more aggressively attack Israeli targets and that they might attack American targets if the United States intervenes. They smell the logic of how much an Israeli invasion of Gaza could help their goal of driving America out of the whole region.

On Thursday, a U.S. Navy warship in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones, apparently launched by the pro-Iranian Houthi militia in Yemen, that might have been headed toward Israel. More missiles, likely from pro-Iranian militias, were fired at U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.

So many rockets are now coming from the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia in South Lebanon that we are one degree away from a full-scale missile war between Israel and Iran’s proxies — and very possibly directly between Israel and Iran.

Israel is not likely to let Iran use its proxies to hit Israel without eventually firing a missile directly at Tehran. Israel has missile-armed submarines that are probably in the Persian Gulf as we speak. If that gets going, it’s Katie, bar the door.

The United States, Russia and China could all be drawn in directly or indirectly.

What makes the situation triply dangerous is that even if Israel acts with herculean restraint to prevent civilian deaths in Gaza, it won’t matter. Think of what happened at Gaza City’s Ahli Arab Hospital on Tuesday.

As the Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea pointed out to me, Palestinian Islamic Jihad achieved more this week with an apparently misfired rocket “than it achieved in all of its successful missile launches.”

How so? After that rocket failed and fell on the Palestinian hospital in Gaza, killing scores of people, Hamas and Islamic Jihad rushed out and claimed — with no evidence — that Israel had deliberately bombed the hospital, setting streets ablaze across the Arab world. When Israel and the United States offered compelling evidence a few hours later that Islamic Jihad accidentally hit the Gaza hospital with its own rocket, it was already too late. The Arab street was on fire, and a meeting of Arab leaders with Biden was canceled.

If people cannot talk openly and honestly about a misfired rocket, imagine what will happen when the first major Israeli invasion of Gaza begins in our wired world, linked by social networks and polluted with misinformation amplified by artificial intelligence.

That is why I believe that Israel would be much better off framing any Gaza operation as “Operation Save Our Hostages” — rather than “Operation End Hamas Once and for All” — and carrying it out, if possible, with repeated surgical strikes and special forces that can still get the Hamas leadership but also draw the brightest possible line between Gazan civilians and the Hamas dictatorship.

But if Israel feels it must reoccupy Gaza to destroy Hamas and restore its deterrence and security — I repeat — it must pair that military operation with a new commitment to pursue a two-state solution with those Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza ready to make peace with Israel.

The hour is late. I have never written a column this urgent before because I have never been more worried about how this situation could spin out of control in ways that could damage Israel irreparably, damage U.S. interests irreparably, damage Palestinians irreparably, threaten Jews everywhere and destabilize the whole world.

Hostages’ families pressure Israel to delay Gaza ground offensive,2023-10-21,"Abu Ubaida, a spokesman for Hamas, said the American mother and daughter were released for “humanitarian reasons” following mediation with Qatar.

On Saturday Qatar said it believed more hostages would be released “very soon” thanks to the ongoing discussions.

“I can’t promise you this will happen today or tomorrow or after tomorrow. But we are taking a path that will very soon lead to release of the hostages, especially civilians,” said Majed Al-Ansari, a Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman.

“We are currently working on an agreement under which all civilian hostages will be initially released,” he told the German Welt am Sonntag newspaper.

Hostages’ families have become a vocal political force in Israel and some have been calling for the Israeli government to strike a deal with Hamas to save their relatives.

Qatar has emerged as a key negotiator, with American officials telling the Wall Street Journal that the Gulf state had warned the group it would cut its aid to the strip if civilian hostages were harmed.

The Qatari negotiation team is also working to secure the release of British hostages, The Telegraph understands.

“The back channels led by Qatar now have proven capacity to deliver and [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu will be under some pressure to let this play out,” said Daniel Levy, president of the US/Middle East Project think tank.

Bargaining proposals are reported to have included a temporary cease-fire, turning water supplies back on for Gaza, and increased humanitarian aid to the territory.

A deal involving the US, Israel and Qatar that would have led to the release of 50 hostages fell apart, officials familiar with the talks told the paper.

Trip to celebrate birthday

The Raanans, who both have dual Israeli-American citizenship, had been on a trip from their home in the Chicago suburb of Evanston to Israel to celebrate Judith’s mother’s birthday.

The mother and daughter were in Nahal Oz, near the Gaza border, when Hamas stormed into southern Israeli towns, killing hundreds of people and abducting others.

Their family had heard nothing from them since the attack, and were later told by US and Israeli officials that they were being held in Gaza.

The number of hostages known to have been seized in the Oct 7 raids has gradually risen over the past fortnight as more intelligence has become available.

Daniel Hagari, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman, said that so far the military had informed the families of 210 people that their relatives were being held captive in Gaza.

Meanwhile, Israel’s forces said they were continuing to prepare for a ground offensive in the enclave, where heavy urban fighting would risk steep casualties on both sides and for the many civilians trapped inside.

The IDF said on Saturday it was “continuing preparations for the next stage of the war - including ground operations”.

"After its bloodiest weekend in its conflict with Israel, what is Hezbollah's strategy?",2023-10-23,"Live updates: Follow the latest news on Israel-Gaza

With 26 Hezbollah fighters having been killed – about half of them over the weekend alone – the past two weeks have been the deadliest of the Iran-backed group’s long-running conflict with Israel since a war in 2006.

But Hezbollah is continuing relatively low-level clashes with Israel, even as the intensity gradually rises, with a second front on Lebanon's southern border yet to fully open.

Experts tell The National that what happens next could depend on the group's close co-ordination with Iran, especially if Tehran sees its Palestinian ally “seriously weakened"", according to Karim Bitar, a professor of International Relations at Saint Joseph University in Beirut.

The Iran-backed Lebanese armed group, part of the Tehran-led Axis of Resistance, reportedly put its death toll during that month-long conflict in the summer of 2006 at about 250.

That was a full-scale, cross-country war that devastated villages and neighbourhoods in Lebanon, unlike the skirmishes of the last two weeks. Around 1,200 Lebanese civilians, 44 Israelis and 121 Israeli soldiers also died in the 34-day war.

For now, exchanges of fire have followed unwritten rules of engagement between the two sides, a managed tit-for-tat struggle. Thus far, neither has wanted to revisit the destruction of 2006.

As Israel pummels Gaza, the Lebanese armed group, for now, has remained relatively restrained. But if Israel pursues a ground invasion of Gaza – said to be imminent – that could change, leading to rapid escalation.

So, is Hezbollah's tactic of managed escalation working, and what are they trying to achieve?

READ MORE Gaza-Israel latest

“Thus far it has continued to be skirmishes around the border areas and part of Hezbollah's tactics to show solidarity with Hamas and also distract the Israeli military campaign from being relaxed in its approach to Gaza,” said Imad Salamey, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at the Lebanese American University in Beirut.

“It thus far has been played out within the rules of engagement,” he said while adding that how those rules will look when Israel escalates even further in Gaza remains to be seen. An increase in fighting on the southern border could be expected or missiles could be fired on major Israeli cities, which could provoke significant retaliatory air strikes.

“We really have to keep in mind that Hezbollah is an integral part of a regional axis that had been co-ordinating its strategy (with Iran) for the past years and that is still coordinating its response,” Prof Bitar said.

“The organic link between Iran and Hezbollah is much stronger than the links between Iran and Hamas.

“As the death count increases, if the operation in Gaza becomes a bloodbath, if Hamas is seriously weakened, there is a genuine risk that Iran could allow Hezbollah, maybe not to open a new front altogether, but at least to strike at Israel from the northern front, to alleviate the pressure on Hamas and Gaza.""

Hezbollah, the Shiite armed group conceived by Iran which first emerged in the Lebanese civil war to oppose Israel's invasion of the country, retains strong and vocal backing within its main support base.

That is despite the deaths of at least 24 Hezbollah fighters, Prof Salamey said. “The support base now is fully mobilised, fully charged, fully behind the party”.

“But all that doesn't matter, this is a proxy group, operating on behalf of Iranian interests in the region. What matters is how Iran is looking at this and seeing this fight,” he added.

And within Lebanon, including among many in the Shiite community, much of the country is deeply opposed to the idea of a new war, even if Hezbollah can operate with virtual impunity.

Lebanon's economic crisis

“So far we have seen a certain restraint because Hezbollah realises that the circumstances have completely changed,” said Prof Bitar.

“We are no longer in 2006, Lebanon is in the midst of a complete state collapse. The communal tensions in Lebanon are still there. Other communities and most Lebanese citizens of all sects are extremely hostile to seeing their country engulfed in a new conflict that would be devastating.”

Embroiled since 2019 in one of the worst economic crises in modern times, Lebanon has been without a president for about a year, has a caretaker government and important positions – including the central bank governor – are being run by acting heads.

Amid all of this, while Hezbollah's well-oiled media machine and senior figures have been continually issuing their messages, the man at the top has remained conspicuously silent.

Hezbollah secretary general Hassan Nasrallah has yet to speak publicly about the escalation, since the escalation of the Israel-Gaza war more than two weeks ago when Hamas fighters breached Gaza's fences and attacked Israeli settlements and army garrisons, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians.

On Sunday, Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah said there need not be any concern and that Mr Nasrallah was closely monitoring developments and directing commanders in battle.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/,-1
'Humanitarian pause' in Hamas-Israel war is urged to aid Gaza civilians,2023-10-24,"Summary

Companies LATEST DEVELOPMENTS:

US opposes ceasefire, wants consideration of humanitarian pause

Eight aid trucks enter Gaza with water, food and medicine

US Secretary of State Blinken says Gazans must be protected

Says they're not to blame for Hamas 'carnage' against Israel

GAZA/JERUSALEM, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The United Nations, United States and Canada appealed on Tuesday for a humanitarian pause in the Israel-Hamas war to allow safe deliveries of aid to civilians short of food, water, medicine and electricity in the Israeli-besieged Gaza Strip.

International pressure for unimpeded aid to Gaza rose as the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled coastal territory said Israeli air strikes had killed more than 700 Palestinians overnight. Ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said this was the highest 24-hour death toll in Israel's two-week-old siege.

U.N. agencies were pleading ""on our knees"" for emergency aid to be let into Gaza unimpeded, saying more than 20 times current deliveries were needed to support the narrow strip's 2.3 million people amid widespread devastation from Israel's aerial blitz.

Eight trucks containing water, food and medicine entered the Gaza Strip from Egypt late on Tuesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.

The United States is negotiating with Israel, neighbouring Egypt and the U.N. to smooth emergency deliveries into Gaza, but have wrangled over procedures for inspecting the aid and over bombardments on the Gaza side of the border.

""While we remain opposed to a ceasefire, we think humanitarian pauses linked to the delivery of aid that still allow Israel to conduct military operations to defend itself are worth consideration,"" a senior U.S. official said.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said after a United Nations Security Council meeting that Israel appeared to be above international law and urged an end to what he termed ""double standards"" in dealing with the Gaza conflict.

In a statement released on social media, the Palestinian health ministry said at least 5,791 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli bombardments since Oct. 7, including 2,360 children. Some 704 were killed in the previous 24 hours alone, it said.

Reuters could not independently verify the ministry figures.

ISRAEL HITS HAMAS TARGETS

The Israeli military said that it killed dozens of Hamas fighters overnight while hitting over 400 Hamas targets, but that it would take time to destroy the Islamist militant group whose deadly cross-border attack on Oct. 7 stunned Israel.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres pleaded on Tuesday for civilians to be protected, voicing concern about ""clear violations of international humanitarian law"" in Gaza.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Security Council: ""Palestinian civilians are not to blame for the carnage committed by Hamas,"" referring to the militants' killing of 1,400 people, mainly civilians, and capture of over 200 in a one-day rampage through Israeli communities near Gaza.

""Palestinian civilians must be protected. That means Hamas must cease using them as human shields ... It means Israel must take all possible precautions to avoid harm to civilians,"" Blinken said.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau echoed Blinken.

""There are a lot of conversations going on now about the need for humanitarian pauses and I think that's something Canada supports,"" he told reporters in Ottawa. ""We must remain anchored on the priorities of protecting innocent (people) and freeing the hostages.""

The World Health Organization, in the latest of increasingly desperate U.N. appeals, called for ""an immediate humanitarian ceasefire"" to prevent food, medicines and fuel supplies from running out in Gaza.

HOSPITALS RUNNING OUT OF FUEL

Doctors in Gaza say patients arriving at hospitals are showing signs of disease caused by overcrowding and poor sanitation after more than 1.4 million people fled their homes for temporary shelters under Israel's heaviest-ever bombardment.

All hospitals say they are running out of fuel to power their electricity generators, leaving them increasingly unable to treat the injured and ill. More than 40 medical centres have halted operations, a health ministry spokesman said.

UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, warned in a post on messaging platform X that it would halt operations in Gaza on Wednesday night because of the lack of fuel.

However, the Israeli military reaffirmed it would bar the entry of fuel to prevent Hamas from seizing it.

DON'T FIGHT WAR 'WITHOUT RULES', MACRON URGES ISRAEL

French President Emmanuel Macron, visiting Israel on Tuesday, told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that France stood ""shoulder to shoulder"" with Israel in its war with Hamas but that it must not fight ""without rules"".

Netanyahu said Israel would try to protect civilians as it worked to ensure they ""will no longer live under Hamas tyranny"".

There appeared to be little prospect of a ceasefire any time soon in the bloodiest chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades, with civilian suffering spreading.

After an air strike in Khan Younis in south Gaza, Abdallah Tabash held his dead daughter Sidra, refusing to let go as he held her bloodstained face and hair. ""I want to look at her as much as I can,"" he said.

Israeli tanks and troops are massed on the border between Israel and Gaza awaiting orders for an expected ground invasion. It is an operation that may be complicated by fears for the hostages' welfare and by militants heavily armed by Iran dug into a crowded urban setting using a vast network of tunnels.

'I'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL'

Hamas on Monday freed two Israeli women who were among the more than 200 hostages taken by gunmen during their mass infiltration on Oct. 7 - the third and fourth to be released.

One of those freed, Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, said she was beaten by militants as she was abducted and had difficulty breathing. ""They stormed into our homes. They beat people. They kidnapped others, the old and the young without distinction,"" she said, seated in a wheelchair and speaking in barely a whisper to reporters outside a Tel Aviv hospital.

""I've been through hell,"" Lifshitz said.

Inside Gaza, a group of hostages were led into what Lifshitz called a ""spider's web"" of damp tunnels and eventually reached a large hall where, under 24-hour guard, a doctor visited every other day and brought them medicines they needed.

DIPLOMACY TO STOP CONFLICT SPREADING

As part of the diplomacy to prevent the conflict from spreading, U.S. President Joe Biden and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman spoke by phone on Tuesday.

They agreed on pursuing broader diplomatic efforts ""to maintain stability across the region and prevent the conflict from expanding,"" the White House said, adding the two leaders would coordinate closely.

Deadly clashes have intensified between the Israeli military and Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, and resurged between Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed, heavily armed Hezbollah group along the two countries' tinderbox border.

Fears of regional conflict focus on Iran's network of proxies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Any wider conflagration would jeopardise security in a region key to global energy supplies.

Lebanese battle blaze after Israel bombs border: officials,2023-10-26,"By Associated Press

BEIRUT: Soldiers and volunteers on Thursday were battling a blaze on Lebanon's southern border caused by Israeli bombing overnight, local officials said, as Israel and Hezbollah exchange near-daily cross-border fire.

Since Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, Lebanon's southern border has seen tit-for-tat exchanges between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah, a Hamas ally.

The Mayor of the border village of Alma al-Shaab, Jean Ghafari, said the fire broke out after an Israeli bombing late Wednesday.

""The blaze reached the edges of the village after midnight"" and is still burning, he told AFP, adding that it ""has come close to houses"".

Security forces, civil defence personnel, United Nations peacekeepers and volunteers were battling the blaze but ""have been unable to completely control it because of strong winds"", Ghafari added.

The municipality said some 70 per cent of the village's population had fled due to Israeli attacks.

An AFP photographer saw fire near houses on the outskirts of Alma al-Shaab and burnt olive trees, with the blaze mainly concentrated between the village and the coastal city of Naqura.

""Overnight (Israeli) bombing with phosphorus led to the fire, which has affected a broad forested area and spread due to the high winds,"" Naqura mayor Abbas Awada told AFP in a statement.

In recent weeks, Lebanon's official National News Agency and Lebanese paramedics have reported fires and injuries due to white phosphorus, while Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of using the incendiary weapon in its war against Hamas militants in Gaza, and in southern Lebanon.

Israel has denied the allegations.

READ THE LIVE UPDATES OF ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR HERE

Parliament speaker Nabih Berri, whose party is allied with Hezbollah, on Thursday condemned Israel's use of ""phosphorus bombs"" along Lebanon's border and blamed ""the international community"" for the blazes, alluding to Western military support for Israel.

Hama's shock attack saw gunmen pour from Gaza into Israel, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping more than 220, according to Israeli officials.

Israel has retaliated with relentless strikes that Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said have killed more than 7,000, also mainly civilians.

Exchanges of fire across the Lebanon-Israel border have since killed at least 57 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally, mostly Hezbollah combatants but also four civilians, including Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah.

Four people have been killed on the Israeli side, including one civilian.

Phosphorus, a substance that catches fire in contact with the air, is used to create smokescreens to hide troop movements, illuminate the battlefield or destroy buildings by fire.

Gaza suffers another communications blackout amid Israeli bombardment,2023-11-01,"Phone and internet services cut despite warnings that communications blackouts exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Israel has cut Gaza’s telecommunication and internet services for a second time despite humanitarian aid agencies warning that such blackouts severely disrupt their work in an already dire situation in the war-torn Palestinian enclave.

Telecom provider Paltel reported a “complete disruption” of communications and internet services in Gaza on Wednesday morning.

The disruption comes after Israel imposed a near-complete communications blackout on Gaza from Friday to Sunday that lasted close to 36 hours.

Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, providing sporadic updates via satellite from Khan Younis, southern Gaza, said on Wednesday that the blackout sent “waves of concern and fear among people and evacuees in the southern part of Gaza who still have family members remaining in the northern part and Gaza City”.

“This blackout is very tragic for people here and an indication that something serious is going on,” he reported. The lack of communication only intensifies people’s concerns “about what’s going to happen to their relatives and loved ones”, he added.

“The difficult part is the inability to know exactly what’s going on. It becomes increasingly difficult to understand the situation in Gaza City and the northern part as Israeli tanks move to separate the north from the south.”

“The blackout also puts the work of humanitarian agencies that try to help people on the ground in jeopardy as they lose contact with their team members. Things are becoming very difficult.”

In a statement, the Palestinian Ministry of Communications appealed to neighbouring Egypt to operate communication stations near the Gaza border and activate roaming service on Egyptian networks, stressing that “the critical humanitarian situation that cannot bear the loss of communication for any longer”.

‘Potential war crimes’

Israel used the previous shutdown to “cover potential war crimes as they started their ground invasion”, said Marwa Fatafta, the Middle East and North Africa policy and advocacy manager at Access Now, a global human rights organisation.

Israel is using internet blackouts as a “warfare tactic to induce more pain on the population”, Fatafta told Al Jazeera.

Even outside the blackouts, communications in Gaza is “sporadic and unreliable”, she added, with Gaza’s G2 mobile network “crushed further” by fuel shortages and damage to infrastructure.

On Monday, US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council that the United States made clear to Israel that it was concerned about a shutdown of communications in the Gaza Strip.

“A shutdown of telecommunication imperils the lives of civilians, UN personnel and humanitarian workers and risks exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” she said.





During the previous blackout, Israel’s chief military spokesperson declined to say whether Israel was behind it but said it would do whatever needed to protect its forces.

Asked whether Israel had knocked out mobile services at the start of the ground offensive that began on Friday night, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said: “We do what we have to do to secure our forces for as long as we must, temporary or permanent, as much as we need to and we will not say anything further about that.”

On Saturday, Elon Musk said he would offer his Starlink satellite internet service to “internationally recognised aid organisations” in Gaza, prompting protests by Israel.

“Hamas will use it for terrorist activities,” Israel’s Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said on X, referring to the group that rules Gaza.

“Perhaps Musk would be willing to condition it with the release of our abducted babies, sons, daughters, elderly people. All of them! By then, my office will cut any ties with Starlink.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/,-1
Civilian death toll: Israeli and Palestinian fatalities continue to rise amid the war with Hamas,2023-11-07,"CNN —

It is a month since Hamas launched its unexpected and brutal attack on Israel. More than 1,400 Israelis were killed in the assault, and more than 240 were taken hostage, according to a count by Israeli officials. The Ministry of Health in Ramallah says more than 10,000 Palestinians have died in the military campaign launched in response by Israel.

Palestinian authorities don’t make a distinction between combatants and civilians but vulnerable groups — children, health workers and journalists — are among those who make up much of the grim and still growing death toll.

The conflict began when Hamas militants launched their deadly cross-border surprise attack on Israel on October 7, in what has been described as the deadliest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. In response, Israel responded with air and land attacks on the Gaza Strip, which have resulted in 10,305 deaths, according to a spokesperson for the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the besieged enclave. CNN cannot independently verify the numbers released by the ministry.

Thousands more Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the last month than those who died in conflicts with Israel over the last 15 years.

Children are nearly half of all casualties

Gaza has one of the youngest populations in the world, with 47% under 18 years old, and the health ministry is reporting that as of November 6, 4,104 children have been killed. UN officials estimate that as of November 5, about 1,270 children have been reported missing and may be trapped under rubble.

If the health ministry numbers are correct, the number of children killed since the conflict began has exceeded the number killed annually in armed conflicts globally in the past four years, according to UN data.

By comparison, 477 children died in Ukraine in 2022, and 83 have died this year as of October 8, according to reports compiled by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

In the densely populated Gaza Strip, home to more than 2 million people, airstrikes have forced about 1.5 million people — about two-thirds of the population — to flee their homes﻿, according to UN figures.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) told people in the northern part of the Gaza Strip to evacuate to the south on October 13. Hospitals, shelters, schools and refugee camps are overwhelmed. A lack of electricity, fuel, food and clean water is creating a humanitarian crisis, UN officials have warned.

On October 31, an Israeli airstrike targeting Hamas commanders and infrastructure in Gaza’s largest refugee camp, Jabalya, left catastrophic damage and killed many. The camp in northern Gaza was bombed for the second time the next day, killing at least 80 people, according to the director of Gaza’s Indonesian hospital. According to a statement by the IDF, the initial airstrike killed several Hamas members, including Ibrahim Biari, whom it described as one of the Hamas commanders responsible for the October 7 attack on Israel. Hamas denied one of its leaders was present.

Attacks on health care

Attacks on health care can include incidents such as an Israeli airstrike that hit﻿ an ambulance outside the Al-Shifa hospital, the largest health facility in Gaza, which Israel said was directed at a Hamas cell. At least 15 died and 50 were wounded, according to the Hamas-run authorities in Gaza.

Health care attacks tracked by the World Health Organization can also include threats and efforts to prevent people from accessing care, removal of health care equipment, and other forms of violence that affect health care.

A deadly blast at the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza resulted in a large number of casualties. Both the cause of the blast and casualty figures are contested – the Gaza health ministry said 471 died, while an initial US intelligence assessment said the number of dead was between 100 and 300. Palestinian officials and some Arab leaders blamed an Israeli airstrike, but Israel said it was the result of a misfired rocket from the Islamic Jihad militant group, a rival to Hamas. A forensic CNN investigation concluded the blast was likely the result of a rocket fired from inside Gaza.

Ukraine experienced nearly 600 attacks on health care in March and April 2022, the first full months after Russia launched its attack on that country, according to WHO data. By comparison, there have been more than 200 such attacks in occupied Palestinian territory since October 7, but far more people have died.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah has reported 192 health workers have been killed and 113 health-care facilities hit. UN officials said 14 hospitals and 51 primary health-care centers are out of service as of November 6, due to damage from airstrikes or a lack of fuel.

‘There is absolutely no safe space’ for journalists

As of November 6, the Committee to Protect Journalists has tracked 37 deaths of journalists and media workers in occupied Palestinian territory since Oct. 7, making it the deadliest period for journalists covering conflict since CPJ began keeping its numbers in 1992.

“There isn’t any real precedent for this,” said Arlene Getz, the editorial director at CPJ.

The single deadliest event for professional journalists was the Nov. 23, 2009, killing of 58 people in Ampatuan town, Maguindanao, in the Philippines; 32 of those were journalists and media workers, according to the CPJ.

“It just feels like there is absolutely no safe space,” Getz said. “It’s dangerous to go to a refugee camp to report, places that used to be safe to go to.”

CPJ is counting deaths of working journalists and media workers in the region as related to their line of work, which is the same way it handled the killing of journalists in Ukraine beginning in 2022. By comparison, 13 journalists were killed in 2022 in Ukraine.

Getz said CPJ sometimes struggles to confirm deaths because they frequently rely on family members for verification.

“Often, our sources for material like this, for confirmation of circumstances and deaths, are family members,” Getz said. “In attacks where families have been killed alongside the journalists, it can be hard to find people who can speak to it.”

Of those killed in Gaza, 32 were Palestinian, four Israeli and one Lebanese, according to the CPJ’s latest figures. An additional eight journalists were reported injured and 11 were missing or detained.",https://www.cnn.com/,-1
"Violence intensifies between Israel, Hezbollah",2023-11-12,"BEIRUT/JERUSALEM - Violence escalated at Lebanon's border with Israel on Sunday as Hezbollah launched explosive drones and powerful missiles at Israeli positions and Israeli air strikes rocked several towns and villages in south Lebanon.

Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah have been trading fire since the war in Gaza erupted two months ago, in their worst hostilities since a 2006 conflict. The violence has largely been contained to the border area.

An Israeli air strike on the town of Aitaroun destroyed five homes and damaged many more, Ali Hijazi, a local official, said. ""Divine intervention prevented anyone being martyred. Three women and two men were wounded,"" he told Reuters.

The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Senior Hezbollah politician Hassan Fadlallah, in a statement to Reuters, said Israeli air strikes were a ""new escalation"" to which the group was responding with new types of attacks, be it ""in the nature of the weapons (used) or the targeted sites"".

The Israeli army earlier said ""suspicious aerial targets"" had crossed from Lebanon and two were intercepted. Two Israeli soldiers were moderately wounded and a number of others lightly injured from shrapnel and smoke inhalation, it said.

Israeli fighter jets carried out ""an extensive series of strikes on Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanese territory"", it said. Sirens sounded in Israel at several locations at the border.

In Beirut, residents saw what appeared to be two warplanes streaking across a clear blue sky, leaving vapour trails behind them.

Hezbollah statements say its attacks aim to support Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Beirut would be turned ""into Gaza"" if Hezbollah started an all-out war.

UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping force in south Lebanon, said in a statement ""the potential for a miscalculation that could trigger a wider conflict is increasing"".

In one of several attacks announced by Hezbollah on Sunday, the group said it had launched the explosive drones at an Israeli command position near Ya'ara. In another, Hezbollah said it had fired Burkan (Volcano) missiles, which carry hundreds of kilograms of explosives.

Israeli air strikes were also reported on the outskirts of the Lebanese village of Yaroun, not far from the location of another of the Israeli positions Hezbollah said it had targeted on Sunday.

Those air strikes broke windows of houses, shops and a school in the nearby village of Rmeich, Toni Elias, a priest in Rmeich, told Reuters by phone.

UN WATCHTOWER STRUCK

Violence at the border has killed more than 120 people in Lebanon, including 85 Hezbollah fighters and 16 civilians. In Israel, the hostilities have killed seven soldiers and four civilians.

UNIFIL said shelling had damaged a watchtower at one of its positions on Saturday afternoon. Nobody had been injured and the source of the fire was under investigation, it said.

The Israeli army said Hezbollah had on Saturday night launched several rockets at Israel, and that one of them was ""launched from 20 meters away from a United Nations compound in southern Lebanon"".

By continuing to fire at Israel from areas ""located only a few meters away from a UN compound"", Hezbollah ""endangers the lives of UNIFIL soldiers"", the Israeli army said.

There was no immediate Hezbollah response to the Israeli statement.

UNIFIL said targeting of its positions ""and any use of the vicinity of our positions to launch attacks"" is unacceptable.",https://www.middle-east-online.com/,-1
Most of Israel’s weapons imports come from the US. Now Biden is rushing even more arms.,2023-11-18,"One area where the Biden administration has set itself apart is in sending weapons to partner countries, and now we’re getting a more complete picture of what the US is sending Israel in the weeks since October 7.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the US has ramped up its previously minimal military aid to the country to an unparalleled $46.7 billion. Ukraine towers over the other major recipients in bar charts of US security assistance for 2022 and ’23. The US is sending so many munitions there that it has apparently strained American factories and led to a whole-of-government effort to revive military supply chains.

The US is also accelerating arms transfers to Israel in response to Hamas’s October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people and resulted in the kidnapping of more than 200. Last month, President Joe Biden announced from the Oval Office that he would seek “an unprecedented support package for Israel’s defense” of $14.3 billion. “We’re surging additional military assistance,” he added.

But while Ukraine has never been a traditional recipient of heavy military aid, the US’s most recent support of the Israeli military builds on a long bipartisan American practice. Israel has received about $3 billion annually, adjusted for inflation, for the last 50 years, and is the largest historical recipient of US security aid. The Obama administration in 2016 announced the biggest security assistance package to the country ever, pledging $38 billion for Israel over the next decade. US support has ensured that Israel maintains its qualitative military edge over neighboring Arab countries by having more advanced weapons systems, something Congress wrote into law in 2008.

Israel would not be able to conduct this war without the US, which over time has provided Israel with about 80 percent of the country’s weapons imports. Israel is using them as part of its large-scale military operation that has so far killed over 11,000 Palestinians and destroyed hospitals and civilian infrastructure. While it is the Israeli Defense Forces doing the killing, the extent of US aid has raised serious questions about American culpability. “Providing weapons that knowingly and significantly would contribute to unlawful attacks can make those providing them complicit in war crimes,” Human Rights Watch said.

Which weapons, exactly, the US is sending to fill Israel’s requests since October 7 has been hitherto kept secret — in contrast to how the US publicizes the weapons it delivers to Ukraine. But Bloomberg this week published a leaked Pentagon document that showed the US has delivered 2,000 Hellfire missiles that can be launched from Apache helicopters, as well as an array of other mortars and ammo, including “36,000 rounds of 30mm cannon ammunition, 1,800 of the requested M141 bunker-buster munitions and at least 3,500 night-vision devices.”

This year, military budgets around the world hit all-time highs. Israel in recent years has been growing its arms export business. It also imports significant weapons from the UK, Italy, Canada, and Germany, but 92 percent of what Israel gets comes from the United States. As researcher William Hartung wrote recently in The Nation, “Israel’s arsenal, and its arms industry, are by and large made in, and financed by, the USA.”

Why Biden’s team is so effective at getting weapons to Israel

The Biden administration has a robust understanding of weapons systems and the business behind them. While any mainstream US administration, Republican or Democrat, would likely be rushing weapons orders to Israel, this administration is uniquely qualified to do so, bringing to bear their successes on Ukraine arms transfer and experience advising weapons-makers. In the second year of his presidency, Biden’s arms sales overtook President Donald Trump’s, who himself had already overseen a big increase.

The House voted in favor of new military assistance to Israel but cut out the Ukraine aid component, so the Senate will likely not pass it. In the meantime, the Biden administration has been efficient and quiet about transfers, using creative tools to jump-start deliveries to Israel that include direct commercial sales from arms-makers (meaning the US isn’t financing the purchases but does allow American weapons manufacturers to sell to Israel), governmental financing vehicles that don’t require congressional approval, and hurrying up orders that were placed before October. Stockpiles meant for US use are also being diverted to Israel. As a senior Pentagon official put it, “expediting security assistance” to Israel has been task number one.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is a former board member of Raytheon, the major military contractor that co-produces Iron Dome receptors with the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. RTX, as Raytheon has been renamed, is one of the most significant providers to Israel. Austin and many other senior appointees to the Pentagon bring a depth of experience working for the arms industry. Even if they aren’t directly involved in the day-to-day — Austin has had to recuse himself from the Department of Defense’s dealings with Raytheon — the heft these appointments bring shows the seriousness with which the Biden administration takes the defense industrial base.

As Austin told the Senate, “We are flowing security assistance to Israel at the speed of war.”

Secretary of State Antony Blinken co-founded WestExec Advisors in 2017, which has worked for military contractors, new military-tech startups, and Israeli companies. Blinken, for his part, advised the defense contractor Boeing, according to his financial disclosure. Last month, Boeing rushed the transfer of 1,000 smart bombs and 1,800 GPS-guidance bomb kits to Israel.

Much of the team that worked to get Israel the $38 billion Obama package over 10 years is leading the way. Other key State Department officials include Daniel Shapiro, who also worked for the Israel spyware maker NSO Group when he was out of government. Intelligence leaders, too, bring vast experience. Avril Haines, the director of the Office of National Intelligence, has worked as an adviser to the data-processing powerhouse Palantir, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel and apparently provides advanced tech to the Israeli military.

The foundation of relationships between the defense industries in the US, Israel, and its other partners in the region also helps. When the world’s biggest aerospace and defense companies gathered at the Dubai Airshow this week, for example, Israeli defense firms and officials kept a low profile — but the big deals continued. Take the US-Israel-UAE triangle, which benefits each country. Boeing, an American company, signed a $52 billion airliner contract with a UAE carrier. On the sidelines of the fair, business people discussed “the impact of the demand for equipment stemming from the conflicts in Gaza” and “Close U.S.-U.A.E. alignment on the Israel-Gaza conflict,” according to the US-UAE Business Council. At the same time, Elbit Systems’ Emirati subsidiary is selling $53 million of military tech to the UAE.

The US has promoted the long lists of weapons it is sending to Ukraine, publishing one-pagers and tallies that go into great detail. But as the Intercept’s Ken Klippenstein noted, the Biden administration has kept the list of weapons it’s sending to Israel secret. The administration has also “sought permission to unilaterally blanket-approve the future sale of military equipment and weapons — like ballistic missiles and artillery ammunition — to Israel without notifying Congress,” according to the watchdog group Women for Weapons Trade Transparency. That would remove a key mechanism for oversight from lawmakers — and scrutiny from the public.

Who’s concerned about arms to Israel?

Many of these weapons are now being used in Gaza, with catastrophic humanitarian results. That has led the United Nations, French President Emmanuel Macron, and a number of international organizations to urge an immediate ceasefire. Human Rights Watch has called for war crimes investigations into the Israeli bombardment of the health care system.

“The emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy,” Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said last month. That heavy bombardment and death toll prompted the UN’s high commissioner for human rights to say Thursday that “the killing of so many civilians cannot be dismissed as collateral damage.”

Given this, some activists are protesting US military aid to Israel and are calling for a ceasefire. One group called Palestine Action has been staging actions in the US and the United Kingdom at the facilities of Elbit Systems, an Israeli military contractor. About 150 protesters picketed Raytheon Technologies in El Segundo, California, for its arms trade with Israel.

Josh Paul, a former senior State Department official overseeing arms sales who resigned in protest last month, has been straightforward in saying that Israel is in violation of international law. “It is my opinion that Israel is committing war crimes in its actions in Gaza right now,” he said. “And it’s not just my opinion. I’ve actually heard from officials across government, including elected officials at a very senior level, who share that opinion but aren’t willing to say it in public.”

This may be setting up Israel for a collision with the Biden administration.

In February 2022, Biden strengthened the human rights component of US arms transfers. The administration put a new emphasis on human rights in the Conventional Arms Transfer policy that added safeguards for “elevating the importance of protecting civilians.” The policy specifically restricted the transfer of weapons that are “more likely than not” to be used in atrocities, including violations of the Geneva Convention or of international humanitarian law.

The Biden administration may be “violating its own conventional arms transfer policy” by sending arms to Israel, as Seth Binder of the Project on Middle East Democracy recently told Jacobin.

But senior Biden officials insist the administration is upholding its commitments. “All of our arms transfers, including arms transfers to Israel, are rooted in the basic proposition that they will be used consistent with [the] law of armed conflict,” Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said last month. “There is no exception here and no difference here from any of our other arms transfers.” The administration regularly conveys to Israel the importance of humanitarian laws, that “innocent civilians must be taken [in]to account for any operation,” according to Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh.

Some of the concerns relate specifically to the kinds of weapons the US delivers. The document that Bloomberg obtained showed that the US is sending Israel 57,000 of the 155mm shells that are used in artillery guns. A group of humanitarian aid groups and security experts had sent a letter to the secretary of defense earlier in the week urging the Biden administration not to send these shells to Israel, saying they are “inherently indiscriminate” and “have a high error radius, often landing 25 meters away from the intended target,” which would be particularly destructive in a place as densely populated as Gaza.

As arms trade accelerates and scrutiny on Israel’s operations heightens, the reason for the strengthening of the arms transfer policy’s human rights component seems more relevant than ever. “It is not in the US national interest to engage in arms transfers where we assess that they are likely to be used in human rights violations,” Christopher Le Mon, a senior State Department official, said in March. “It does not advance our national interests, it does not advance our national security.”",https://www.vox.com/,-1
"World Children’s Day tragedy: Gaza’s 5,500 lives lost to Israel’s attacks",2023-11-20,"One out of every 200 children in Gaza has been killed by Israeli attacks in the past six weeks.

World Children’s Day, celebrated annually on November 20, is a global initiative promoting children’s rights, safety, education, health and happiness.

It comes this year amid Israel’s war on Gaza. About half of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people are children.

Since October 7, Israeli attacks have killed at least 5,500 children, according to Palestinian officials. That is one Palestinian child killed every 10 minutes, or about one out of every 200 children in the Gaza Strip.

An additional 1,800 children are missing under the rubble, most of them presumed dead. A further 9,000 children have been injured, many with life-changing consequences. Many of these children have lived through the trauma of multiple wars.

Israel-Hamas war creates a problematic AI weapons boom,2023-11-25,"Already, Israel is using self-piloting drones from Shield AI for close-quarters indoor combat and has reportedly requested 200 Switchblade 600 kamikaze drones from another U.S. company, according to DefenseScoop. Jon Gruen, CEO of Fortem Technologies, which supplied Ukrainian forces with radar and autonomous anti-drone aircraft, said he was having “early-stage conversations” with Israelis about whether the company’s AI systems could work in the dense, urban environments in Gaza.

This surge of interest echoes the one driven by the even larger conflict in Ukraine, which has been a proving ground for new AI-powered defense technology — much of it ordered by the Ukrainian government directly from U.S. tech companies.

AI ethicists have raised concerns about the Israeli military’s use of AI-driven technologies to target Palestinians, pointing to reports that the army used AI to strike more than 11,000 targets in Gaza since Hamas militants launched a deadly assault on Israel on Oct 7.

The Israeli defense ministry did not elaborate in response to questions about its use of AI.

These sophisticated platforms also pose a new challenge for the Biden administration. On Nov. 13, the U.S. began implementing a new foreign policy to govern the responsible military use of such technologies. The policy, first unveiled in the Hague in February and endorsed by 45 other countries, is an effort to keep the military use of AI and autonomous systems within the international law of war.

But neither Israel nor Ukraine are signatories, leaving a growing hole in the young effort to keep high-tech weapons operating within agreed-upon lines.

Asked about Israel’s compliance with the U.S.-led declaration on military AI, a spokesperson for the State Department said “it is too early” to draw conclusions about why some countries have not endorsed the document, or to suggest that non-endorsing countries disagree with the declaration or will not adhere to its principles.

Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the CSIS International Security Program, said in an interview that “it’s very difficult” to coordinate international agreement between nations on the military use of AI for two reasons: “One is that the technology is evolving so quickly that the description constraints you put on it today may no longer may not be relevant five years from now because the technology will be so different. The other thing is that so much of this technology is civilian, that it’s hard to restrict military development without also affecting civilian development.”

In Gaza, drones are being largely used for surveillance, scouting locations and looking for militants without risking soldiers’ lives, according to Israeli and U.S. military technology developers and observers interviewed for this story.

Israel discloses few specifics of how it uses this technology, and some worry the Israeli military is using unreliable AI recommendation systems to identify targets for lethal operations.

Ukrainian forces have used experimental AI systems to identify Russian soldiers, weapons and unit positions from social media and satellite feeds.

Observers say that Israel is a particularly fast-moving theater for new weaponry because it has a technically sophisticated military, large budget, and — crucially — close existing ties to the U.S. tech industry.

“The difference, now maybe more than ever, is the speed at which technology can move and the willingness of suppliers of that technology to deal directly with Israel,” said Arun Seraphin, executive director of the National Defense Industrial Association’s Institute for Emerging Technologies.

Though the weapons trade is subject to scrutiny and regulation, autonomous systems also raise special challenges. Unlike traditional military hardware, buyers are able to reconfigure these smart platforms for their own needs, adding a layer of inscrutability to how these systems are used.

While many of the U.S.-built, AI-enabled drones sent to Israel are not armed and not programmed by the manufacturers to identify specific vehicles or people, these airborne robots are designed to leave room for military customers to run their own custom software, which they often prefer to do, multiple manufacturers told POLITICO.

Shield AI co-founder Brandon Tseng confirmed that users are able to customize the Nova 2 drones that the IDF is using to search for barricaded shooters and civilians in buildings targeted by Hamas fighters.

Matt Mahmoudi, who authored Amnesty International’s May report documenting Israel’s use of facial recognition systems in Palestinian territories, told POLITICO that historically, U.S. technology companies contracting with Israeli defense authorities have had little insight or control over how their products are used by the Israeli government, pointing to several instances of the Israeli military running its own AI software on hardware imported from other countries to closely monitor the movement of Palestinians.

Complicating the issue are the blurred lines between military and non-military technology. In the industry, the term is “dual-use” — a system, like a drone-swarm equipped with computer-vision, that might be used for commercial purposes but could also be deployed in combat.

The Technology Policy Lab at the Center for a New American Security writes that “dual-use technologies are more difficult to regulate at both the national and international levels” and notes that in order for the U.S. to best apply export controls, it “requires complementary commitment from technology-leading allies and partners.”

Exportable military-use AI systems can run the gamut from commercial products to autonomous weapons. Even in cases where AI-enabled systems are explicitly designed as weapons, meaning U.S. authorities are required by law to monitor the transfer of these systems to another country, the State Department only recently adopted policies to monitor civilian harm caused by these weapons, in response to Congressional pressure.

But enforcement is still a question mark: Josh Paul, a former State Department official, wrote that a planned report on the policy’s implementation was canceled because the department wanted to avoid any debate on civilian harm risks in Gaza from U.S. weapons transfers to Israel.

A Skydio spokesperson said the company is currently not aware of any users breaching its code of conduct and would “take appropriate measures” to mitigate the misuse of its drones. A Shield AI spokesperson said the company is confident its products are not being used to violate humanitarian norms in Israel and “would not support” the unethical use of its products.

In response to queries about whether the U.S. government is able to closely monitor high-tech defense platforms sent by smaller companies to Israel or Ukraine, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said it was restricted from publicly commenting or confirming the details of commercially licensed defense trade activity.

Some observers point out that the Pentagon derives some benefit from watching new systems tested elsewhere.

“The great value for the United States is we’re getting to field test all this new stuff,” said CSIS’s Cancian — a process that takes much longer in peacetime environments and allows the Pentagon to place its bets on novel technologies with more confidence, he added.",https://www.politico.com/,-1
"Syria: Israel Attacks Damascus Airport, Military Base",2023-11-26,"Photo Credit: Tomás Del Coro from Las Vegas, Nevada, USA

Israel allegedly attacked the Damascus International Airport on Sunday afternoon for the second time in three days, once again putting the airport out of service, Syrian media reported.

There was also an explosion at the Maza Military Airport in southwest Damascus. Maza is a military air base used by the Syrian Air Force and by Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) special forces. Its airport is used by the family of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad as well.

Syrian airports are the preferred destination for Iranian aircraft to deliver military supplies to Iran’s Hezbollah proxy in nearby Lebanon, and Israel has carried out repeated attacks to block those deliveries.

Israeli media reported that the air strikes targeted the runway of the airport in addition to other nearby military targets, which included the Al-Maza military base in western Damascus.

A similar attack was carried out against Damascus International Airport this past weekend, but the airport was to resume operations on Sunday. The last time the airport was attacked, its runways were disabled to the point that the airport was shut down for more than a month.

According to Israeli and international media, flights to Damascus are being rerouted to Latakia and Aleppo airports. Both have been attacked in the past to prevent Iran from delivery advanced weaponry to Hezbollah and likeminded terror organizations.",https://www.jewishpress.com/,-1
University of Pennsylvania and the Israel-Hamas war: an explainer,2023-11-29,"Local reverberations of the Israel-Hamas war have roiled the University of Pennsylvania. From funding strikes to hate speech, and graffiti to doxing, it’s been a complex, difficult time at the West Philly school.

Since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, the Penn community has seen protests by donors, protests by students, and various threats of violence. The response from university administration to all or some of this has upset stakeholders on all sides, and there have been calls for President Liz Magill to resign.

There’s now an ongoing student sit-in, as well as a protest petition signed by academics around the world. Demonstrations continue at least weekly, most recently over the screening of a film critical of Israel, which the university tried to stop.

At its base, the disagreement is over how to differentiate between valid political stances and outright antisemitism — and how administrators with the power to shut down events interpret that distinction.

Penn isn’t entirely unique in its tumultuous situation. Ivy League siblings Harvard and Columbia University are both dealing with some of the same.

Harvard has also seen authority-backed calls for its president to resign, and some notable donors have cut ties, though to a lesser extent than at Penn. The administration at Columbia has faced steep criticism for its suspension of two student groups, and alumni have rallied in support of pro-Palestinian students.

One major difference is that some from Columbia and Harvard have been doxed via a screen-paneled truck displaying the names and faces of students and faculty, describing them as “leading antisemites” in their communities. The trucks were paid for by a conservative organization called Accuracy in Media, and have not yet come to Philadelphia.

One reason the situation at Penn tipped so quickly into tension might be because antisemitic incidents had already occurred on campus prior to the recent overseas attacks.

What antisemitic incidents happened before Oct. 7?

Just before Rosh Hashanah, in late September, a spray-painted swastika was found in the spray room at the Weitzman School of Design.

That same week, Penn Hillel, the on-campus center for Jewish undergrads, was vandalized. The perpetrator also yelled “antisemitic obscenities,” including “F**k the Jews” and “They killed JC,” a student told The Daily Pennsylvanian, Penn’s diligent campus newspaper.

Penn Police found the individual on campus and concluded that the person — who has not been identified as a student — was “experiencing a crisis,” and transported them to a medical facility.

Penn Hillel supporters had been working to stop the Palestine Writes Literature Festival, set to occur at the university the following day. Campus law enforcement did not connect the two, but the dustup kicked off a heated conversation about what constitutes antisemitism on campus

What is Palestine Writes and why was it so controversial?

Palestine Writes first began virtually in 2020 as a celebration of Palestinian literary culture, a canon that unsurprisingly includes — but is hardly limited to — work critical of the state of Israel. The festival isn’t officially affiliated with Penn, but was allowed to hold events on campus for this year’s second edition. It had the support of Penn’s Near East Languages and Civilizations Department and its Middle East Center, along with many student groups.

Before the festival, Penn Hillel objected to the participation of some of the slated speakers, the most famous being Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters, who has in the past sharply criticized Israel and used antisemitic slurs. Penn Hillel demanded that Penn President Liz Magill bar Waters from speaking.

She didn’t take that step, but her administration did release a statement distancing the university from the festival and discussing concerns about “many” of its speakers. That statement in turn prompted a critical response from students and faculty members with “deep concerns” about how Magill was representing the event.

How did that blow up into national news?

As far back as August, the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia and regional director of the Anti-Defamation League were in touch with Penn leadership, asking for a public statement “questioning the judgment of and distancing itself from the academic departments” who helped organize Palestine Writes.

After Magill issued her statement, festival organizers obtained and published the above correspondence along with a letter to Penn leadership by novelist and co-organizer Susan Abulhawa. Like other student groups and faculty, Abulhawa criticized Magill’s statement, saying it failed to distinguish between antisemitism and criticisms of Israel or defend Penn faculty and students.

“It is particularly galling and insulting — if not outright libelous — to suggest that we pose a threat to Jewish students on campus,” wrote Abulhawa.

The American Jewish Committee, a national nonprofit that advocates for American Jews who support Israel, also pointed to Philadelphia-based national news commentator Marc Lamont Hill’s involvement as a problem. They were joined by other national organizations in opposing Penn’s hosting of the festival throughout September.

In the end, Pink Floyd’s Waters was not allowed to physically attend; he spoke virtually instead. The festival was a widely attended celebration of culture and critique that occurred without incident.

Did donors actually cut off funding? Who called for Magill’s resignation?

All that happened before the Oct. 7 attack. When Penn, like many other institutions, issued a statement about the “horrific assault on Israel by Hamas that targeted civilians and the taking of hostages over the weekend,” it set off a firestorm.

Several alumni and trustees declared they would withdraw or stop significant donations to the university, including Estée Lauder billionaire Ronald Lauder (who had tried hard to get Palestine Writes canceled), “Law and Order” creator Dick Wolf, and former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr.

Some said it was because the statement, which came out on Oct. 10, wasn’t issued quickly enough. Some said the school wasn’t being supportive enough of its Jewish students. Others were still upset about the handling of Palestine Writes. Multiple people wrote letters accusing the university of being insufficiently condemnatory of events in the world and on campus.

To date, dozens of donors have cut off their financial support, per the Daily Pennsylvanian, and one Board of Trustees member resigned.

Marc Rowan, chair of the Wharton School’s Board of Advisors and former trustee, made an additional push to have Magill and university board chair Scott Bok resign.

Magill never considered resignation, per a statement to the Penn community, and the push petered out when more than 50 past and present trustees reportedly agreed she should stay.

How many different groups have staged demonstrations on campus?

As donors made their feelings known with their words and their pocketbooks, physical demonstrations began to fill Penn’s campus. There were demonstrators of all ideologies — some supporting Israel, others calling for a ceasefire, and some mourning those killed due to the war.

Student groups involved in demonstrations include:

Penn Against the Occupation

Penn Hillel

Penn Arab Student Society

Penn’s Muslim Students’ Association

Police Free Penn

Penn Chavurah

Non-Penn related groups like Drexel’s Students for Justice in Palestine, Philly Palestine Coalition, and If Not Now Philly have also participated in on-campus events.

What kind of incidents on campus have people concerned?

Beyond the vandalization of Penn Hillel and the design school, a number of incidents have raised concerns for student safety on campus, along with acts that were not endangering but indicative of tensions around the Israel-Hamas war.

This is not a comprehensive rundown, but the list includes:

Violent and death threats sent to students and faculty who participated in pro-Palestinian, pro-ceasefire events

Antisemitic graffiti comparing Jews to Nazis painted next to the house of Alpha Epsilon Pi, a fraternity based on Jewish values (the incident is being investigated as a hate crime)

Antisemitic messages threatening violence sent to Penn staff in early November, another incident being investigated as a hate crime. Law enforcement officers swept both Penn Hillel and Lauder College House, finding no threats to student safety.

A Penn student arrested for allegedly stealing an Israeli flag from a Campus Apartments building.

Though no physical violence has taken place at a demonstration, in-person confrontations at war-related rallies have left many students of varying orientations deeply shaken.

Penn is one of seven schools that are involved in a U.S. Dept. of Education investigation into antisemitism and Islamophobia on college campuses. Magill is slated to testify Dec. 5 on the matter in front of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce.

How have faculty responded?

There have been two major open letters signed by Penn faculty.

The first was sent out on Oct. 24, with over 300 — largely from Wharton School of Business and the Perelman School of Medicine — signing onto a statement that expresses solidarity with Israel, while disavowing Islamophobia and antisemitism.

A second letter on Nov. 20 was signed by hundreds of professors from around the world, advocating for Penn students to be allowed to demonstrate on campus.

It also pushed for Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian students to see and feel the same support from Penn leadership as their Jewish peers, and called out “online death threats, libelous public petitions, and harassment and intimidation by both colleagues and the Penn Administration” that faculty, staff and students have been dealing with.

A few letters from smaller groups of academics have also come out.

Penn’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors released an Oct. 28 letter citing concerns about trustee influence and harassment, asserting that “our university leadership has intensified fear and animosity by associating antisemitism and terrorism with an overly broad range of academic programming and political speech.”

Penn’s Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies issued a brief statement shortly after Oct. 7, and later announced a new lecture series on Jewish life in American universities.

Outside of the university, the national Middle Eastern Studies Association released a letter to Magill and other administrators describing defamatory harassment that faculty members were facing and noting discrepancies they saw in Penn’s response.

After the administration tried to bar the screening of the film “Israelism,” the director of the Penn Middle East Center submitted his resignation.

How is Penn addressing the issue so far?

At the start of November, the university released “Penn’s Action Plan to Combat Antisemitism.”

The plan focuses on elevating safety at all student worship centers, inaugurates formal partnerships with the American Jewish Committee and a new student advisory group to fight antisemitism, and points to forthcoming educational efforts to ensure “antisemitism awareness” is an “integral part of our equity and inclusion programs.”

A new 20-person “University Task Force on Antisemitism” has the mission of engaging with the campus to understand the contours of antisemitism at Penn and find ways to address it. It’s due to file a report by Feb. 15, and wrap up its work by next May.

“Our Jewish community is afraid. Our Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities feel unseen and unheard,” said Magill, in a speech announcing the plan to university trustees. “I condemn the death threats and doxing that many at Penn are experiencing based only on their identity, their affiliations, or their views of the suffering in this war.”

There’s also a forthcoming conversation series from Penn’s School of Arts and Sciences, with a plan to host group discussions, symposiums, and public programs addressing the Israel-Hamas war and other issues pertaining to the region. As of this writing, no events have yet been scheduled.

Is Penn’s action plan starting at the right place?

Penn’s action plan will work off of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) “working definition,” which has come under fire for conflating criticisms of the state of Israel with antisemitism.

Groups that have advocated against using that definition include professors at University College London, a cohort of 100-plus Israeli and international organizations that lobbied the United Nations, and even the definition’s original creator.

Language has also become a touchstone at Penn in other ways. On Nov. 9, messages were projected onto Huntsman Hall, Irvine Auditorium, and Penn Commons. They read:

“From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”

“Let Gaza live”

“Zionism is racism”

“Penn funds Palestinian genocide”

“From West Philly to Palestine, occupation is a crime”

“Free Palestine”

“Liz Magill is complicit in genocide”

“10,000 murdered by Israeli occupation since October 7”

Magill described the projections as “vile, antisemitic messages,” adding that “too many have masked antisemitism in hostile rhetoric” over the generations.

But many others at Penn saw the messages as either critical of Israel or anti-Zionist, but not antisemitic.

So there’s a sit-in now?

On Nov. 14, students began a sit-in at Houston Hall dubbed “Freedom School for Palestine.”

Led largely by a network of graduate students, conveners of the “teach-in” space have three main demands: That Penn, institutionally, calls for a ceasefire, that freedom of speech is protected on campus, and a general call to “institute critical thought on Palestine.”

The students see shortcomings with the university’s responses to campus demonstrators advocating for a ceasefire, and with the way Penn is handling its mission of education in the midst of a world-shifting event.

So far, the sit-in has largely been a space for students to gather and share their thoughts and experiences with invited guest speakers, often faculty from Penn or other universities or people with direct experience of life in Israel and the Palestinian territories.

Students have meticulously followed Penn’s “Guidelines on Open Expression,” and the university has allowed the sit-in to remain for over two weeks.",https://billypenn.com/,-1
"Hezbollah strikes Israeli military command center with artillery, rockets",2023-12-02,"Fighters from the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah have struck Israeli military positions close to the border between Lebanon and the 1948 occupied territories.

Lebanon’s Arabic-language al-Manar television channel, citing a Hezbollah statement released on Saturday, reported that the group launched projectiles at a command center belonging to the Israeli army at Biranit barracks in northern Israel, causing casualties in the targeted area.

The Lebanese resistance fighters also struck positions in the Khirbat Maer Israeli post near the border. The Israeli army later stated that shells were fired at the Shomera area in northern Israel, and that it responded with artillery fire.

Israeli shelling, meanwhile, targeted the outskirts of the southern Lebanese border towns of Tayr Harfa, Naqoura, Maroun al-Ras, Yaroun, Blida, Alma al-Shaab and al-Qawzah, al-Manar TV said.

The artillery and rocket strikes were conducted as Israel keeps bombing the besieged Gaza Strip after a seven-day truce with the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas ended.

Hezbollah also announced the death of one more of its fighters, identified as Khodor Abboud, who hailed from the southern Lebanese town of Deir Ames.

On Friday, Hezbollah said two of its members were among three people killed in Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon.

The group in separate statements identified the members killed as Mohammad Mazraani and Wajih Msheik.

A source close to the group said Mazraani was killed in his home along with his mother Nasifa.

The Israeli regime has been waging sporadic attacks on southern Lebanon since October 7, when it launched a devastating war against the besieged Gaza Strip.

Hezbollah has mounted near daily rocket attacks on Israeli positions at the border, while Israel has conducted air and artillery strikes in southern Lebanon.

Senior Hezbollah politician Hassan Fadlallah has said the group was vigilant and ready after the Hamas-Israel truce ended.

“In Lebanon, we are concerned in facing this challenge, being vigilant, and always ready to confront any possibility and any danger that may arise in our country,” he said.

“No one thinks that Lebanon has been spared from this Zionist targeting or that what is happening in Gaza cannot affect the situation in Lebanon,” Fadlallah noted.",https://www.presstv.ir/,-1
"Tourist from Boston killed in shark attack in Bahamas, police say",2023-12-04,"Local News Tourist from Boston killed in shark attack in Bahamas, police say It was not immediately clear what type of shark attacked the woman while she was paddleboarding.





SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A female tourist from Boston was killed Monday by a shark while paddleboarding in the Bahamas, police told reporters.

The victim, who was not identified, was attacked less than a mile off the western end of New Providence island, where the capital, Nassau, is located. She was paddleboarding with a man who was not injured, according to Police Sgt. Desiree Ferguson.

“We extend our heartfelt condolences…for this most unfortunate situation,” she said.

Police said a lifeguard rescued both people with a boat upon seeing what was happening, but the woman suffered serious injuries to the right side of her body and was declared dead at the scene despite CPR efforts.

It was not immediately clear what type of shark attacked the woman. A police superintendent did not immediately respond to a message requesting comment.

Gavin Naylor, program director of the International Shark Attack File in Florida, said in an interview that there have been a couple of shark-related fatalities reported in the Bahamas in the past five years.

He noted that the Bahamas has a “huge” tourist population, adding that there are a lot of people in the water and a lot of visitors who want to view sharks from a fishing boat or dive with them.

“So the sharks get acclimated, and the animals are a little bit less cautious than they otherwise might be,” he said.

Between 30 to 40 shark species live around the Bahamas, although the Caribbean reef shark, the bull shark, the tiger shark and the black tip shark have the highest bite frequency, Naylor said.

“Usually, it’s an accidental bite. They think it’s something else,” he said. “Once in a while, they’ll actually single out people, and it’s very intentional.”

Fatal shark attacks are rare, with only an average of five to six reported worldwide a year, most of them occurring in Australia, Naylor said. Last year, there were a total of 57 unprovoked bites around the globe, the majority of them in the U.S., according to the International Shark Attack File.

At least 33 confirmed unprovoked shark attacks have been reported in the Bahamas since 1580, with the island ranking ninth worldwide, according to the file.

The Nassau Guardian newspaper reported that authorities in the Bahamas are still searching for a German woman who went missing late last month after she was apparently attacked while diving.

Last year, a shark killed a U.S. cruise ship passenger from Pennsylvania who was snorkeling in the northern Bahamas near Green Cay.

Most shark attacks in the Caribbean occur in the Bahamas, although a rare shark attack was reported in the French Caribbean territory of St. Martin three years ago.

Israel military commander claims army is in 'heart' of southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Yunis,2023-12-05,"The Israeli army is now in the “heart” of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, a senior Israeli commander said on Tuesday, Anadolu Agency reports.

“We are in the heart of Jabalya, in the heart of Shujaiya, and since last night, in the heart of Khan Yunis,” Israeli army Southern Command, General Yaron Finkelman, said in a statement.

Despite Finkelman’s use of the term “heart” of Khan Yunis,

statements by the Al-Qassam Brigades today clarified that the ongoing clashes with the Israeli army in Khan Yunis are concentrated in the eastern areas of the city, primarily agricultural regions

“We are in the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation in terms of terrorists killed, the number of fire fights, and the use of firepower from the land and air,” the Commander added.

Israel resumed air and ground attacks last Friday on the Gaza Strip after the end of a week-long humanitarian pause with Hamas.

Despite earlier ordering Gazans to go from northern Gaza to the south, implying that the south was safer, Israel recently started an offensive into the south, further displacing a shell-shocked population of millions.

At least 15,899 Palestinians have been killed and more than 42,000 injured since Israel launched a massive military campaign on the Gaza Strip following a cross-border attack by Hamas on 7 October, according to Gaza’s health authorities.

The Israeli death toll in the Hamas attack stood at 1,200, according to official figures.

"Israel has received 10,000 tons of US military equipment since start of Gaza war",2023-12-06,"The United States supplied Israel with over 10,000 tons of military equipment since the start of the Gaza war on 7 October, the Israeli Defence Ministry said Wednesday, Anadolu Agency reports.

In a statement, the Ministry said that the 200th cargo plane carrying military equipment for the army had arrived in Israel.

The equipment includes armoured vehicles, armaments, personal protective equipment, medical supplies, ammunition and more, the statement added.

The first US cargo plane arrived in Israel on 11 October.

“Since then, over 10,000 tons of military equipment were delivered to Israel since the beginning of the war,” the Defence Ministry said.

Israel resumed its military offensive on the Gaza Strip on Friday, after the end of a week-long humanitarian pause with the Palestinian group, Hamas.

At least 16,248 Palestinians have been killed and more than 43,616 others injured in relentless air and ground attacks on the enclave since 7 October following a cross-border attack by Hamas.

The Israeli death toll in the Hamas attack stood at 1,200, according to official figures.

Hamas fired rockets from Gaza humanitarian zone - News Today,2023-12-08,"Hamas fired rockets at Israel from the humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, near displaced civilians and a United Nations facility, the Israel Defence Forces said on Thursday. The military also released visual evidence of the launch site where, on Wednesday at around 3:59 pm, a barrage of 12 rockets was fired at the city of Beersheva. “The rockets were launched near the tents of Gazan citizens who were evacuated to the south of the Gaza Strip for their protection and near the UN facilities,” the IDF said. Earlier on Wednesday, Hamas fired rockets from the humanitarian zone at 12:52 pm and 2:12 pm further endangering Palestinian civilians, the IDF added. Palestinian terrorists have fired more than 11,500 rockets towards Israeli territory since October 7. Three people were lightly wounded in Israel on Tuesday by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip. Israel has long noted that Hamas fires rockets from civilian areas, including schools, hospitals, mosques and UN buildings, and has found evidence of this during its ground operation that began on October 27. Israeli soldiers found missiles and military gear hidden among UN relief supplies in the northern Gaza Strip. One hundred ten rockets, including 30 Grad projectiles, were found hidden among boxes belonging to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which supports Palestinian refugees and their descendants, the IDF said. The rockets were found inside a home in a densely populated area. At least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Hamas currently holds 137 men, women, children, soldiers and foreigners captive in Gaza.

Israeli strike kills local official in southern Lebanon: Report,2023-12-11,"A local Lebanese official has been killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon as tensions escalate along the border between the Arab country and the Israeli-occupied territories amid Tel Aviv’s brutal aggression against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.

Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) reported the fatality on Monday and said Hussein Mansour, the 80-year-old mayor of the border town of Taybeh, had been killed in an Israeli strike targeting his home.

""The shell that targeted (Mansour's) house did not explode"" but struck the local official and killed him, the NNA said, adding that eight other people were on a balcony with him at the time.

The broadcaster also reported Israeli bombardment of several Lebanese border towns, including Jabal al-Rihan, Khallet Khazen, Yaroun, and Meir Mimas.

Other Lebanese media outlets also confirmed reports on Mansour's martyrdom in the Israeli targeting of his residence.

In retaliatory strikes on Monday, Lebanon's resistance movement Hezbollah said it shelled three Israeli military outposts near the border with southern Lebanon.

Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire since early October, shortly after the regime launched its devastating war on the besieged Gaza Strip following a surprise operation by the Palestinian resistance groups into the Israeli-occupied territories.

Since the exchanges began, more than 120 people have been killed on the Lebanese side of the border, mostly Hezbollah fighters and more than a dozen civilians, according to an AFP tally.

The movement has vowed to keep up its retaliatory operations as long as the regime sustains its warfare against the besieged Palestinian territory.

The Israeli aggression has so far killed more than 18,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and wounded over 49,000 others.

The Tel Aviv regime has also imposed a “complete siege” on the territory, cutting off fuel, electricity, food and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there.",https://www.presstv.ir/,-1

"27-year-old Israeli woman, Inbar Haiman, taken hostage by Hamas confirmed dead: ‘Creative girl full of joy’",2023-12-16,"An Israeli hostage abducted by Hamas on Oct. 7 from the Supernova music festival has been confirmed dead.

Inbar Haiman, described as a “creative girl full of joy,” was murdered at some point after she was kidnapped from the desert rave, the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum said Friday.

Haiman’s cause of death was not confirmed by the Forum. Her body is still believed to be in the Gaza Strip, the Times of Israel added.

Haiman, 27, was a visual communications student from Haifa, in northern Israel, the Forum said.

She was remembered as a “gifted” and “creative girl full of joy,” the Forum’s announced read.

Haiman is survived by her parents, brother, and her partner, Noam Alon, the Times of Israel said.

She was volunteering at the festival when Hamas attacked in the early hours, the outlet reported.

She texted Alon, who told her to avoid the roads where the armed terrorists were killing fellow revelers while they tried to flee.

The young woman’s boyfriend and family eventually lost touch with her, and shared a description of her tattoos and outfit on social media in a desperate bid for information.

Two witnesses eventually told the frantic loved ones they saw Haiman – who they recognized from her distinctive leggings – hiding under a stage with friends, before running to take cover under a bush, the Times of Israel explained.

“The video came as a kind of relief. The other option – that she was dead – was far worse. Knowing that she’s now a hostage in Gaza isn’t easy – it’s something you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy – but it’s better than the alternative,” Noam Alon told The Guardian of the upsetting footage in late October.

One of Alon’s relatives also paid tribute to Haiman in a tear-jerking Facebook post after her death was confirmed Saturday.

On Saturday, the IDF verified that three male hostages had been inadvertently shot and killed by its soldiers. The Israeli Defense Force also confirmed the deaths of 21 of the hostages held by Hamas – a number that only increased the anxiety of the families still waiting for news of their loved ones.

“We are playing Russian roulette,” Ruby Chen, whose son Itay is among the 128 people still being held hostage, told the Times of Israel outside the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv.

France condemns killing of its worker in Israeli strike in Gaza’s Rafah,2023-12-17,"The killing comes as French top diplomat Catherine Colonna in Israel to appeal for truce and lasting peace.

The French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs has condemned the Israeli bombing of a residential building in Rafah that killed one of its staff in a region previously declared a safe zone.

“France condemns this bombing of a residential building which caused the death of many other civilians. We demand that all light be shed by the Israeli authorities on the circumstances of this bombing, as quickly as possible,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

The house was hit on Wednesday evening, killing the employee and 10 others who had been sheltering with colleagues and their family members in the residential location.

The employee had been working with the French government in Gaza since 2002, and some of his family members had already been evacuated from Gaza, the ministry said, offering condolences.

The ministry statement is released at a time when external pressure on Israel is increasing due to its “indiscriminate” bombing raids in Gaza. More than 80 percent of the nearly 19,000 Palestinians killed are said to be civilians.

French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna on Sunday pressed for an “immediate and durable” truce in the Gaza war, adding Paris is “deeply concerned” over the situation in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.

“Too many civilians are being killed,” Colonna said during remarks in Tel Aviv with her Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen, as Israel presses on with its offensive after the October 7 attacks that has sent tensions spiralling across the region.

The foreign minister also condemned the October 7 attack by Hamas and plans to meet with the families of the Israeli captives held in the Gaza Strip.

At least 1,140 people, most of them civilians, were killed in the Hamas attack and 240 were taken captive. Dozens of them were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners as part of a truce deal late last month.

Colonna also plans to pursue an agreement with her Palestinian counterpart Riyad al-Maliki in the occupied West Bank during her trip.

Shortly before her arrival in Israel, Colonna condemned increasing attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.

“Since October 7, unfortunately, some settlers, driven by their ideological blindness… have committed crimes” against Palestinians, she said, adding that “these settlers must be punished”.

Disease could kill more children in Gaza than Israeli bombings: UN official,2023-12-19,"A senior United Nations official has warned that more children in Gaza could die from diseases than from the Israeli bombings in the besieged Palestinian territory.

UNICEF spokesperson James Elder called for an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza, warning once more that without a truce disease-deaths could outnumber bombing-deaths in the besieged Palestinian territory.

In a Tuesday posting on UNICEF's X platform, Elder announced, “Without sufficient safe water, food, and sanitation that only a humanitarian ceasefire can bring - child deaths due to disease could surpass those killed in bombardments.”

“Without sufficient safe water, food and sanitation that only a humanitarian ceasefire can bring - child deaths due to disease could surpass those killed in bombardments.”

So far, the death toll of Israel’s war on Gaza nears 20,000 of which, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, more than 7,700 were children killed by the Zionist war machine.

Earlier, the UN’s children’s agency said entire neighborhoods in Gaza, where children used to play and go to school, had been reduced to rubble in the month-long bombings of Israeli warplanes.

“The Gaza Strip is the most dangerous place in the world to be a child,” UNICEF Middle East and North Africa said in an X post on Monday. “Children need an immediate, long-lasting humanitarian ceasefire.

The Israeli war machine initiated its premeditated war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian Hamas resistance group carried out Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in retaliation to the Zionists' intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people.

Since the war's start, the Apartheid regime forces have been attacking Gaza towns, villages and refugee camps from the air, land and sea with bombings, shelling and direct military engagement.

In addition, the area is under the “complete siege” of Israeli forces, blocking water, food, medicine and fuel to the region, causing starvation and spreading disease among the 2.3 million defenseless trapped Palestinians.",https://www.presstv.ir/,-1
Hamas leader visits Cairo for Gaza cease-fire talks,2023-12-20,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip >> The Israeli military on Wednesday said it had uncovered a major Hamas command center in the heart of Gaza City, inflicting what it described as a serious blow to the Islamic militant group as pressure grows on Israel to scale back its devastating military offensive in the coastal enclave.

The army said it had exposed the center of a vast underground network used by Hamas to move weapons, militants and supplies throughout the Gaza Strip. Israel has said destroying the tunnels is a major objective of the offensive.

The announcement came as Hamas’ top leader arrived in Egypt for talks aimed at brokering a temporary cease-fire and a new deal for Hamas to swap Israeli hostages for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

Israeli leaders have vowed to press ahead with the two-month-old offensive, launched in response to a bloody cross-border attack by Hamas in October that killed some 1,200 people and saw 240 others taken hostage.

The offensive has devastated much of northern Gaza, killed nearly 20,000 Palestinians, and driven some 1.9 million people — nearly 85% of the population — from their homes. The widespread destruction and heavy civilian death toll has drawn increasing international calls for a cease-fire.

Hamas militants have put up stiff resistance lately against Israeli ground troops, and its forces appear to remain largely intact in southern Gaza. It also continues to fire rockets into Israel every day.

The United States, Israel’s closest ally, has continued to support Israel’s right to defend itself while also urging greater effort to protect Gaza’s civilians.

But in some of the toughest American language yet, Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday called on Israel to scale back its operation.

“It’s clear that the conflict will move and needs to move to a lower intensity phase,” Blinken said. He said the U.S. wants to see “more targeted operations” with smaller levels of forces focused on specific targets, such as Hamas’ leaders and the group’s tunnel network.

“As that happens, I think you’ll see as well, the harm done to civilians also decrease significantly,” he said.

His comments were more pointed than statements by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who in a visit to Israel this week said the U.S. would not dictate any timeframes to its ally.

TUNNEL NETWORK

The Israeli military escorted Israeli reporters into Palestine Square in the heart of Gaza City to show off what it described as the center of Hamas’ tunnel network.

Military commanders boasted that they had uncovered offices, tunnels and elevators used by Hamas’ top leaders. The military released videos of underground offices and claimed to have found a wheelchair belonging to Hamas’ shadowy military commander, Mohammed Deif, who has not been seen in public in years.

The army’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the army had located a vast underground complex. “They all used this infrastructure routinely, during emergencies and also at the beginning of the war on Oct. 7,” he said. He said the tunnels stretched across Gaza and into major hospitals. The claims could not be independently verified.

Hagari also indicated that Israel was winding down its operations in northern Gaza, including Gaza City, where it has been battling Hamas militants for weeks. He said the army had moved into a final remaining Hamas stronghold, the Gaza City neighborhood of Tufah.

But the army also acknowledged a significant misstep. An investigation into its soldiers’ mistaken shooting of three Israelis held hostage in Gaza found that, five days before the shooting, a military search dog with a body camera had captured audio of them shouting for help in Hebrew.

Hagari said the recording was not reviewed until after the hostages were killed while trying to make themselves known to Israeli forces.

The incident has sparked an uproar in Israel and put pressure on the government to reach a new deal with Hamas. The military chief has said the shooting was against its rules of engagement.

The Israeli military campaign now is largely focused on southern Gaza, where it says Hamas’ leaders are hiding.

“We will continue the war until the end. It will continue until Hamas is destroyed, until victory,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement. “Whoever thinks we will stop is detached from reality.”

CEASE-FIRE TALKS GAIN MOMENTUM

As Netanyahu vowed to continue the war, there were new signs of progress in cease-fire talks.

Hamas’ top leader, Ismail Haniyeh, traveled to Cairo for talks on the war, part of a flurry of diplomacy. In recent days, top Israeli, American and Qatari officials have also held cease-fire talks.

“These are very serious discussions and negotiations, and we hope that they lead somewhere,” the White House’s national security spokesman, John Kirby, said aboard Air Force One while traveling with President Joe Biden to Wisconsin.

Biden, however, indicated a deal was still a ways off. “There’s no expectation at this point, but we are pushing,” he said. Asked about the rising death toll in Gaza, Biden said: It’s tragic.”

Hamas says no more hostages will be released until the war ends. It is insisting on the release of large numbers of Palestinian prisoners, including high-level militants convicted in deadly attacks, for remaining captives.

Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official in Beirut, said the efforts right now are focused on how to “stop this aggression, especially that our enemy now knows that it cannot achieve any of its goals.”

Israel has rejected Hamas’ demands for a mass prisoner release so far. But it has a history of lopsided exchanges for captive Israelis, and the government is under heavy public pressure to bring the hostages home safely.

Egypt, along with Qatar and the U.S., helped mediate a weeklong cease-fire in November in which Hamas freed over 100 hostages in exchange for Israel’s release of 240 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas and other militants are still holding an estimated 129 captives, though roughly 20 are believed to have died in captivity.

U.N. Security Council members are negotiating an Arab-sponsored resolution to halt the fighting in some way to allow for an increase in desperately needed humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza.

A vote on the resolution, first scheduled for Monday, was pushed back again on Wednesday in the hopes of getting the U.S. to support it or allow it to pass after it vetoed an earlier cease-fire call.

HUMANITARIAN CRISIS

Mobile phone and internet service was down across Gaza again on Wednesday. The outage could complicate efforts to communicate with Hamas leaders inside the territory who went into hiding after Oct. 7.

The war has led to a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people are crammed into shelters and tent camps amid shortages of food, medicine and other basic supplies. Israel’s foreign minister traveled to Cyprus to discuss the possibility of establishing a maritime corridor that would allow the delivery of large amounts of humanitarian aid to Gaza.

At least 46 people were killed and more than 100 wounded early Wednesday after Israel bombarded the urban Jabaliya refugee camp near Gaza City, according to Munir al-Bursh, a senior Health Ministry official.

At least five people were killed and dozens injured in another strike that hit three residential homes and a mosque in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah Wednesday, health officials said.

The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Tuesday the death toll since the start of the war had risen to more than 19,600. It does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.

Israel’s military says 134 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive. Israel says it has killed some 7,000 militants, without providing evidence. It blames civilian deaths in Gaza on Hamas, saying it uses them as human shields when it fights in residential areas.

Arab League: Israel's crimes shame it and those that support it,2023-12-21,"The Arab League has affirmed that the crime in Gaza committed by the Israeli occupation is not only a shame to Israel, but also to those who supported, endorsed, or remained silent about these crimes.

Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit made these remarks via his videoconference speech during the sixth session of the Arab-Russian Cooperation Forum held in Morocco yesterday.

He called for an “immediate ceasefire,” adding that “anyone who opposes an immediate ceasefire in Gaza has the blood of innocents on their hands.”

Aboul Gheit added that what is happening in Gaza is a massacre, genocide and ethnic cleansing.

The occupation’s plan has become clear, which is to destroy the Palestinian community in Gaza, eliminate the possibility of life in the Strip, or forcibly displace its people so that they might become separated from their land. Then, the Palestinian issue ends and is liquidated, the secretary-general explained.

Aboul Gheit praised the stance of the countries that, from the beginning, have clearly expressed a balanced position, the essence of which is that the occupation and its continuation are the core of the problem and the root of the issue and that the history of the conflict did not begin on 7 October, but long before that.

"Hezbollah retaliates, strikes Israeli military sites near Lebanon border",2023-12-23,"Fighters from the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah have conducted retaliatory strikes against Israeli positions, targeting barracks and gathering sites near the border in response to the regime’s genocidal war in Gaza.

Lebanon’s Arabic-language al-Manar television channel, citing a Hezbollah statement released on Saturday, reported that a group of Israeli soldiers were struck at Birkat Risha outpost in the north of the occupied Palestinian territories.

A number of Israeli soldiers were also injured when Lebanese resistance fighters targeted Bayad Blida site.

Similar strikes also hit Israeli positions in Tayhat Hill and Mount Nothor.

Hezbollah launches the strikes in solidarity with the resilient Palestinian population in Gaza.

Moreover, Hezbollah fighters targeted Jal al-Alam site near the occupied Lebanese areas with heavy-caliber Burkan (Volcano) missiles.

Israel’s military said rocket fire from Lebanon had killed one of its soldiers and wounded another near the border. The soldiers were hit during “operational activity” in the Shtula area in the vicinity of southern Lebanon, the military said in a statement.

The regime has been conducting sporadic attacks on southern Lebanon since October 7.

More than 140 people have been killed on the Lebanese side of the border since then, mostly Hezbollah fighters and more than two dozen civilians, according to an AFP tally.

Israel says at least eight of its soldiers and four settlers have been killed in the area, and the Lebanese army lost a soldier.",https://www.presstv.ir/,-1
"Hezbollah targets Israeli site, tells settlers to leave",2024-03-06,"Hamas lashes out at Abbas’s ‘unilateral’ designation of new PM

CAIRO: The Islamist group Hamas on Friday criticized the “unilateral” designation by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of an ally and leading business figure as prime minister with a mandate to help reform the Palestinian Authority (PA) and rebuild Gaza.

Mohammad Mustafa’s appointment comes after mounting pressure to overhaul the governing body of the occupied Palestinian territories and improve governance in the occupied West Bank where it is based.

Hamas said the decision was taken without consulting it despite recently taking part in a meeting in Moscow also attended by Abbas’ Fatah movement to end long-time divisions weakening Palestinian political aspirations.

“We express our rejection of continuing this approach that has inflicted and continues to inflict harm on our people and our national cause,” Hamas said in a statement.

“Making individual decisions and engaging in superficial and empty steps such as forming a new government without national consensus only reinforces a policy of unilateralism and deepens division.”

At a time of war with Israel, Palestinians needed a unified leadership preparing for free democratic elections involving all components of their society, it added.

In the West Bank, Fatah fired back at Hamas’ criticism of Abbas, blaming it for what had befallen Gaza since it unilaterally carried out “the Oct7 adventure.”

“Has Hamas consulted the Palestinian leadership as it is negotiating with Israel now and offering the concessions, in a bid to secure guarantees of its leaders’ personal safety in return?” said the Fatah statement.

FOREIGN DEMANDS

As president, Abbas remains by far the most powerful figure in the Palestinian Authority, but the appointment of a new government showed willingness to meet international demands for change in the administration.

Mustafa, who helped organize the reconstruction of Gaza following a previous conflict, was assigned to lead the relief and rebuilding of the area, which has been shattered by more than five months of war, and reform Palestinian Authority institutions, according to the designation letter.

He replaces former Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh who, along with his government, resigned in February.

Arab and international efforts have so far failed to reconcile Hamas and Fatah, which makes up the backbone of the PA, since the Hamas 2007 take over of Gaza, a move that reduced Abbas’s authority to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Palestinians want both territories as the core of a future independent state.

Hamas said any attempt to exclude it from the political scene after the war was “delusional.”

In a recent warning, a security official told a Hamas-linked news website that attempts by clans or community leaders to cooperate with Israel’s plans to administer Gaza would be seen as “treason” and met with an “iron fist.”

But the group denied media reports it killed some local clan leaders in recent days for meddling with aid distribution.",https://www.arabnews.com/,-1
Netanyahu says Israel will push on with offensive in Gaza's Rafah as ceasefire talks stalled,2024-03-08,"Israel-Hamas war: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday asserted that his military will push on with its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, including in the southern city of Rafah, despite growing international pressure to stop. The statement comes as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas appear to be stalled, with both sides accusing each other of not making compromises.

Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas after its fighters attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 253, according to Israeli tallies. More than 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's subsequent offensive, according to Palestinian health officials, prompting global condemnation and calls for an immediate ceasefire.

""Today, I want to tell you clearly: The IDF will continue to operate against all of Hamas's battalions throughout the Strip – and this includes Rafah, Hamas's last stronghold. Whoever tells us not to operate in Rafah, is telling us to lose the war – and that will not happen,"" said Netanyahu on Thursday during an event at an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) training base.

""There is international pressure and it's growing, but particularly when the international pressure rises, we must close ranks, we need to stand together against the attempts to stop the war,"" he said, adding that eliminating Hamas' rule, the return of all hostages and preventing any future threat to Israel from Gaza are key priorities. Netanyahu also said whoever is talking about not invading Rafah is telling Israel to lose the war.

Ceasefire talks between Israel, Hamas

The Israeli PM also said the country must push back against a ""calculated attempt"" to blame it for Hamas' crimes. ""It is Hamas that murdered, massacred and raped our brothers and sisters. It is Hamas that abducted our sons and daughters. It is Hamas that is perpetrating war crimes against its people and ours on a daily basis. And we are fighting these monsters in order to ensure our very existence,"" he said.

This comes after ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in the presence of negotiators from the US, Egypt and Qatar failed to make any breakthrough as Hamas' delegation returned from Cairo, with both warring sides blaming each other. Egyptian security sources said talks, taking place without an Israeli delegation in Cairo, would resume on Sunday, the expected start of Ramadan.

Senior US administration officials said the onus was on Hamas to complete a hostage deal and attributed the delay to what they described as Hamas so far not agreeing to release sick and elderly hostages. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters Israel had been ""thwarting"" efforts to conclude a ceasefire deal by rejecting Hamas' demands to end its offensive in the enclave, withdraw its forces, and ensure freedom of entry for aid and the return of displaced people.

Netanyahu had reiterated his intention on Thursday to press on with the military campaign in Gaza. Israel has previously said its aim is to destroy Hamas and that any ceasefire must be temporary. It has also pressed for a list of hostages still alive and held by Hamas in Gaza. ""We've made very, very clear and this has been reiterated by the US that, unfortunately, it is Hamas who is the stumbling block right now by not telling us who is alive and who they have in their custody,"" said Israeli government spokesman David Mencer.

Hamas officials have said a ceasefire must be in place before the hostages are freed, Israeli forces must leave Gaza and all Gazans must be able to return to homes they have fled. Hamas has said it can't provide a list of the hostages who are still alive without a ceasefire as the hostages are scattered across the war zone.

The news of the Hamas delegation leaving Cairo without an accord was met with despair in Gaza, which is in the grip of a deep humanitarian crisis after five months of war. ""I feel great disappointment and despair, fear too,"" said Abir, who along with her 12-member family has taken refuge in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, where more than half of the enclave's 2.3 million people are now sheltering.

US military to set up temporary aid port for Gaza

Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden has ordered the American military to set up a temporary port off the coast of Gaza, joining international partners in trying to carve out a sea route to deliver food and other aid to desperate Palestinian civilians cut off by the Hamas-Israel war and by Israeli restrictions on humanitarian access by land.

While reiterating his support for Israel, Biden used the announcement and the bright spotlight of his State of the Union speech to renew months of US calls to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to change how he conducts the war, including by allowing in more aid to Gaza and doing more to protect humanitarian workers there.

""To the leadership of Israel I say this: Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority. As we look to the future, the only real solution to this situation is a two-state solution,"" he added.

What Is Israel’s Goal in Lebanon? Increasing Cross-Border Attacks Risk Expanding the Gaza War,2024-03-13,"This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today’s show in Lebanon, where Israel is expanding its attacks for the third day in a row, with Israeli warplanes striking deep in Lebanon amidst growing concern about a regional escalation. Today, an Israeli drone struck a car outside the Palestinian refugee camp of Rashidieh, near the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, killing both passengers. This follows a pair of Israeli airstrikes Tuesday that killed two and wounded nine in northeastern Lebanon. On Monday, Israel struck areas near the Lebanese city of Baalbek. Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which is an ally of Hamas, responded by launching a barrage of over a hundred rockets at northern Israel Tuesday in what’s been described as the heaviest attack since October 7th.

For more, we’re joined by Rami Khouri, Palestinian American journalist, senior public policy fellow at the American University of Beirut. His most recent piece for Al Jazeera is headlined “Watching the watchdogs: Biden, US media and Arab-American political power.”

Rami, welcome back to Democracy Now! We want to talk about Gaza —

RAMI KHOURI: Thank you.

AMY GOODMAN: — in a minute, but let’s begin with Lebanon and what’s happening with the attacks between Israel and Lebanon. If you can talk about the significance? Are we talking about an escalation into a regional war? What’s happening on the border, Rami?

RAMI KHOURI: Well, we are definitely witnessing an escalation. It’s been going on since the beginning of the current phase of fighting in Gaza in early October. It’s picked up a lot in the last two weeks. The Israelis have made it very clear, in public statements, openly, they want to not destroy Hezbollah, but they want to reduce its power or neutralize it as a possible military force that will threaten them, because they see Hezbollah, correctly, very closely linked to Iran, and they see Iran — I’m not so sure correctly, Israel sees Iran as its major threat in the region.

So, the Israelis keep talking about “We’ve got to do something about Hezbollah,” including they’re willing to have a war, which they expect the Americans will come in and help them on, just as the Americans are helping them do the genocide in Gaza, and now the Americans, oddly, are helping them do the humanitarian food deliveries into Gaza. So, the United States seems to be a kind of button that Israel pushes when it needs assistance in some kind of dramatic, usually illegal and often ineffective action. It pushes the Washington button, and Washington jumps up and says, “Yes, sir. What can I do?” And the Israelis expect the Americans to help them knock down Hezbollah’s power. It’s not clear that this is easily done.

And the reason Hezbollah is so strong is because it forced Israel in 2006, in the last big war in Lebanon and Israel, forced it into a ceasefire and new rules of engagement, which have generally held and still kind of hold now, because it’s sort of tit for tat: You kill one of our men, we kill one of yours; you attack a post, a military post, we attack one of yours.

But this is escalating now, and it’s not clear if Israel is really ready to or wants to actually have a full-scale war. Neither side, I think, will achieve very much, other than massive destruction in both countries. So, I remain skeptical about a full-scale war, but I’m expecting this level of tit for tat and even a higher level of assassinations, maybe hitting some infrastructure here and there — I expect that to ramp up a little bit, but not an all-out war.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But already the tit for tat, Rami Khouri, has led to considerable displacement. Some 90,000 people have been forced to flee southern Lebanon. And at the same time, about 80,000 Israelis have been evacuated from the northern towns and villages by the Israeli government. If a greater conflict was to break out, what would be the impact, in your assessment, throughout the Middle East?

RAMI KHOURI: That’s always difficult to predict. What we can predict — and we see it now — is that Arab governments will not risk anything in terms of helping the Palestinians or opposing the Israelis. They will issue statements, they’ll do press conferences, they’ll send some aid, but they won’t risk anything strategic or substantive in confronting Israel, while the majority of Arab people are critical of Israel, but they’re helpless. They have no power. They used to be citizens. They’ve now been transformed into basically consumers. All they can do is buy fried chicken and go to the movies, and they have no power. Arab citizens are powerless. They’re neutered beings politically. Therefore, the policies of Arab governments tend to dominate. And that’s why in the last 30 years you’ve seen the rise of these very powerful nonstate armed actors — Hezbollah and Hamas, Ansar Allah in Yemen, the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq and Syria and a bunch of others. And so, what we would expect to see is more military action by some of these nonstate very powerful actors against Israel, if there’s an all-out war, and the Arab countries, you know, asking for a ceasefire.

The Iranians are the big question mark. Would the Iranians get involved in a direct confrontation with Israel? My suspicion is that they probably would not want to do that, because they know that that will bring in the Americans. Now, some people argue, “Well, that’s what they want. They want the Americans to do another foolish military adventure, like Vietnam, like Afghanistan, like Iraq. They would like the Americans to do one more in Iran.”

So, these are all speculative ideas. Nobody really knows. The only thing we know for sure is that Hezbollah and Hamas, and Ansar Allah in Yemen, the Houthis, they’re ready to fight. They’re prepared to fight. Whether this is a suicidal, you know, stupid policy is up for history to tell us. But what we’ve seen so far is that they have been able to exchange fire with Israel — and the U.S., in some cases — and wake up and do it again the next day.

This is not something that we should celebrate. You know, the Middle East is a cauldron of nonstop violence, including what you mentioned, the huge amount of displaced civilians. This is painful to ordinary families. I witnessed it in Lebanon, in Palestine, in Jordan and Syria, to see the refugees that have to run around when wars happen. You know, it happened in Iraq. It happened in Kuwait, in Yemen, all over the place. And we don’t want to see another round of this.

But this is the inevitable consequence of allowing the Arab-Israeli conflict to expand for a hundred years, for a century, with direct, explicit, ongoing and expanding American and British aid and arms and political protection at the U.N. If you do that, this is what you’re going to get. So, it’s kind of insincere and rather immature and comic for American officials or British officials to say, “Look, there’s a danger of a war.” Of course there’s a danger of a bigger war, because your policies, combined with the policies of the Israelis and some of the Arabs, have brought us to this point, so that if you want to stop a future war, you address the underlying conditions. Why is there no big war in Afghanistan right now or Vietnam? It’s because the underlying conditions were removed, and therefore there’s some kind of normal situation.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, you characterize Hezbollah as a nonstate actor, but what about the relationship between Hezbollah and the Lebanese central government, for those people not familiar with Lebanese politics?

RAMI KHOURI: Hezbollah is stronger than the Lebanese government militarily. There’s no question about that. But they recognize that they are part of the Lebanese government. They’re in Parliament. They have ministers in the government, on and off. They’re not an alien force. But they expanded and became strong because the Lebanese government was unable to protect the south of Lebanon in the '60s and ’70s and ’80s, when it increasingly came under threats from Israel. When the Palestinians' guerrillas set up shop in south Lebanon at one point, that brought in Israeli reprisals. And because the Lebanese government could not protect Lebanon, Hezbollah emerged organically as the military force that both protects the south and protects all of Lebanon, in cahoots with others in the country. There’s other smaller leftist and other forces working with it. And they have a very uneasy relationship, because they are so powerful. They can spark a war, as has happened before, between Israel and Hezbollah, and the Lebanese government just can’t do anything about it. And the Lebanese people suffer, because the airport gets bombed, the electricity system stops, and terrible things happen during war.

And the Lebanese government constantly is trying to work out with Hezbollah an understanding of how they can coexist, but this is really pretty impossible to do, again, until you resolve the underlying Arab-Israeli, Palestinian-Israeli conflict. And once that is resolved, there will be no need for Hezbollah to have all these arms to protect Lebanon from Israeli attacks, because Hezbollah is not going to go and try to destroy Israel. It’s been clear that these groups, they’re critical of Israel, they trash talk it, they badmouth it, they make all these threats, but they also negotiate with it, they make prisoner exchanges, and they’ve all made it clear: If the Palestinians reach an agreement with Israel that is fair to both sides and the majority of Palestinian people support it, they will go along with it. There’s no question about that.

So, we have to constantly take our gaze away from the awful, terrible things happening now, or the potential for worse things to happen, and look back on the central, defining issue in this region. And there’s two of those issues. One of them is nonstop foreign military intervention since Napoleon, and that foreign military intervention is expanding, as we see now, especially with the Americans and the Russians and Iranians and Turks and others and British. And the other one is the Arab-Israeli conflict. These are the two biggest drivers of regional tension and warfare and instability. And those have to be addressed.",https://www.democracynow.org/,-1
Israeli Diplomats Assail Schumer's Remarks: 'Disgusted',2024-03-14,"Two current and former ambassadors blasted Thursday's speech delivered by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, with one saying the New York Democrat should be ""ashamed"" for calling for new elections in Israel to supplant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his handling of the Gaza war.

David Friedman, U.S. ambassador to Israel under then-President Donald Trump who oversaw the move of the American embassy to Jerusalem in 2017, said he was ""disgusted"" by Schumer's speech on the Senate floor Thursday.

Current Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Herzog panned Schumer's speech as ""unhelpful"" and ""counterproductive.""

Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the U.S., said Netanyahu has ""lost his way"" and accused the prime minister of being ""too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza."" Netanyahu, he went on, ""no longer fits the needs of Israel after Oct. 7,"" when Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,200 Israelis, including women, children, and infants.

""Israel is a sovereign democracy. It is unhelpful, all the more so as Israel is at war against the genocidal terror organization Hamas, to comment on the domestic political scene of a democratic ally. It is counterproductive to our common goals,"" Herzog posted to X on Thursday.

Friedman, ambassador to Israel from 2017-21, wasn't nearly as diplomatic.

""I am just disgusted by this speech. The democratically elected leader of Israel is leading his nation in the defense of a barbaric foe, deploying a successful strategy that is broadly supported by the people of Israel, and the Senate Majority Leader publicly pushes for regime change in the middle of a war! He should be ashamed. It's all about politics,"" he said in a post to X.

In a subsequent post, Friedman wrote, ""The two-state solution died on October 7, 2023, and was buried by Chuck Schumer on March 14, 2024.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called Schumer's speech ""grotesque"" and ""unprecedented.""

""It is grotesque and hypocritical for Americans who hyperventilate about interference in our own democracy to call for the removal of the democratically elected leader of Israel,"" McConnell said in his own floor rebuttal.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called Schumer's remarks ""highly inappropriate,"" and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said Schumer should apologize for his ""very inappropriate"" remarks.

National security communications adviser John Kirby told reporters that Schumer, who he said ""feels strongly about this,"" gave the White House advance notice of his speech. Kirby did not elaborate as to whether President Joe Biden agreed with Schumer.",https://www.newsmax.com/,-1

About one in every three children under the age of two years in the Northern Gaza Strip suffers from acute malnutrition, a UNICEF report published on Friday says.

According to the report, ""Malnutrition among children is spreading fast and reaching devastating and unprecedented levels in the Gaza Strip due to the wide-reaching impacts of the war and ongoing restrictions on aid delivery.""

The report further states that at least 23 children in the Northern Gaza Strip ""have reportedly died from malnutrition and dehydration in recent weeks.""

Nutrition screenings conducted by the organization in the northern Strip in February found that ""4.5 percent of the children in shelters and health centers suffer from severe wasting, the most life-threatening form of malnutrition, which puts children at highest risk of medical complications and death.""

The report added that the prevalence of acute malnutrition among children under five years of age in norther Gaza increased from 13 percent to 25 percent.

""The speed at which this catastrophic child malnutrition crisis in Gaza has unfolded is shocking, especially when desperately needed assistance has been at the ready just a few miles away,"" said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director.

""We have repeatedly attempted to deliver additional aid, and we have repeatedly called for the access challenges we have faced for months to be addressed,"" she added. ""Instead…our efforts in providing life-saving aid are being hampered by unnecessary restrictions, and those are costing children their lives.""

""An immediate humanitarian cease-fire continues to provide the only chance to save children's lives and end their suffering. We also need multiple land border crossings that allow aid to be reliably delivered at scale, including the northern Gaza, along with the security assurances and unimpeded passage needed to distribute that aid, without delays or access impediments,"" she added.",https://www.haaretz.com/,-1
Israeli defense chief to visit Washington as tensions rise over Gaza war,2024-03-24,"Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is heading to Washington on Sunday, at a time of increasingly strained relations with his country’s main military backer and ally, as Israel continues to defy U.S. calls to reduce the suffering in Gaza. He is set to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and other senior officials, the Israeli government said in a statement.

Gallant’s visit, which the Israeli government said was at Austin’s invitation, comes after Blinken and Israeli leaders confronted one another over the trajectory of the war on Friday. On a trip to Tel Aviv, the top U.S. diplomat called on Israel not to invade the crowded city of Rafah, in southern Gaza, where nearly 1.5 million displaced Palestinians are sheltering, warning that “it risks further isolating Israel around the world and jeopardizing its long-term security.”

A separate Israeli delegation including Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer and the head of the National Security Council, Tzachi Hanegbi, will also leave for Washington on Sunday, an Israeli official told The Washington Post, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the schedule has not been made public.

The visit was requested by President Biden so officials could “hear U.S. concerns about Israel’s current Rafah planning and to lay out an alternative approach,” Sullivan told reporters last week.

On Sunday, Vice President Harris told ABC’s “This Week” that any military operation in Rafah “would be a huge mistake,” adding that the Biden administration had made that point clear “in multiple conversations and in every way.”

Israel has proposed moving displaced families in Rafah to “humanitarian islands” in other parts of the enclave. Harris said she had studied the maps and “there is nowhere for those people to go.” Asked whether there would be “consequences” from the United States for an Israeli operation in Rafah, she said, “I am ruling out nothing.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressing the nation late Sunday on the Jewish holiday of Purim, said: “It is impossible to defeat the sheer evil [of Hamas] by leaving it intact in Rafah. … We will enter Rafah and achieve total victory.”

Meanwhile, heavy fighting continued in other parts of southern Gaza on Sunday. The Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet, Israel’s military intelligence agency, launched an operation in the al-Amal neighborhood in Khan Younis, the IDF said in a statement. The operation involved airstrikes on about 40 targets, including military compounds and underground tunnels, the statement said. The IDF said its troops were “encircling the area and continuing to eliminate” militants.

Israeli forces were also operating in northern Khan Younis, in the al-Qarara area, the IDF said, saying troops killed militants with tanks and conducted airstrikes targeting facilities that it said were used by Hamas for weapons storage. The Post could not independently verify the reports.

Fighting was also reported near health facilities in Khan Younis. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said Sunday that Israeli forces were “besieging” al-Amal Hospital.

The organization said Israeli forces were using bulldozers and smoke bombs around the hospital while demanding via drones that everyone inside evacuate. Earlier, the PRCS said one of its emergency services volunteers was killed “at dawn” by Israeli gunfire; before his death, the group said, the volunteer had reported “intense and continuous shelling” around the facility, as well as “continuous gunfire.”

The Post could not independently verify the claims. The IDF said it was not currently operating in hospitals in the al-Amal area and called on Hamas to “cease using hospitals” and other civilian infrastructure as shields. Gaza’s Health Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In Gaza City, Israel said its raid of al-Shifa Hospital continued Sunday. The nearly week-long military operation has prompted alarm from global health officials and increasingly desperate appeals from patients and displaced residents trapped in the medical complex. Health services at al-Shifa, once Gaza’s largest and best-equipped hospital, were only recently restored to minimal levels, the World Health Organization said, after an Israeli attack on the facility in November. The Israeli military said its forces have apprehended 480 suspects in the latest raid and have “located weapons” and stockpiles of cash in the hospital.

Israel told the United Nations it will no longer approve U.N.

More than a dozen Democratic senators are calling on the Biden administration to reject Israel’s claim that it has not been violating international law by restricting humanitarian aid to Gaza. Israel sent assurances last week that its usage of U.S.-supplied weapons employed in Gaza had not violated international or U.S. laws. The State Department is working to assess whether Israel’s assurances are “credible and reliable.”

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres reiterated pleas for a cease-fire during a visit to the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza on Saturday. “I want Palestinians in Gaza to know: You are not alone,” Guterres during a visit to the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza on Saturday. “I want Palestinians in Gaza to know: You are not alone,” Guterres told reporters . On Friday, Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution at the U.N. Security Council that set out the “imperative of an immediate and sustained ceasefire” in Gaza.

At least 32,226 people have been killed and 74,518 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.

Israel bans UNRWA from delivering aid to northern Gaza,2024-03-25,"Displaced Palestinians receive flour bags at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees school in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on Jan. 28.

March 25 (UPI) -- The United Nations said Sunday that Israel is banning its relief agency from delivering humanitarian aid to northern Gaza, which is under the gravest threat of famine of the entire Palestinian enclave. Gaza, and in particular northern Gaza, is on the brink of famine and the ban comes as the United Nations continues to ply pressure on Israel to do more to allow the free flow of humanitarian aid to Palestinians. Advertisement

Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of UNRWA, announced the ban on X, stating by preventing them from fulfilling their mandate in Gaza ""the clock will tick faster towards famine & many more will die of hunger, dehydration + lack of shelter.""

""This is outrageous & makes it intentional to obstruct lifesaving assistance during a man-made famine,"" he said. ""These restrictions must be lifted.""

UNRWA is the largest relief agency operating in Gaza, and employees some 13,000 staff there. Along with supplying aid to Gaza, it runs more than 20 health centers, hundreds of schools and refugee camps in the enclave.

Though no reason for the ban was given, Israel has accused 12 UNRWA staff of having participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on the Middle Eastern country that killed 1,200 Israelis and ignited the months-long war.

UNRWA responded by firing 10 of the 12 named, as the two others were already dead, and launching an investigation into the allegations.

The ban also comes after two UNRWA food convoys were denied entry to northern Gaza in the past week, and it has been unable to deliver food to the region in nearly two months.

Israel's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories, better known as COGAT, responded to UNRWA's complaints over its food being turned back by accusing it on X of failing to live up to its mandate and being ""deeply involved with a terrorist organization.""

As the ban was announced, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres was calling for Gaza to be flooded with humanitarian aid and criticizing Israel for hindering relief from entering the Palestinian enclave.

Guterres made the remarks during a solidarity mission to Egypt to mark the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.

He said Sunday that ""Palestinians in Gaza desperately need what has been promised -- a flood of aid. Not trickles. Not drops,"" and that to facilitate this ""requires Israel removing the remaining obstacles and chokepoints to relief.""

""It requires more crossings and and access points,"" he said. ""It requires an exponential increase in commercial goods. And, I repeat, it requires an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.""

Aid to the dependent Gaza was halted by Israel with the start of the war, and it took more than two weeks for the first convoy of trucks to enter the enclave.

Since then, an average of 126 good trucks have entered Gaza daily, according to COGAT.

Prior to the war, some 500 trucks would enter daily.

Meanwhile, trucks queue outside the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, the main way aid can enter Gaza.

COGAT has blamed the United Nations and its relief networks for their failure to distribute the aid, while the United Nations has been pointing its finger at Israel.

Guterres visited the Rafah border crossing in Egypt over the weekend. There, he saw ""a long line of blocked relief trucks, while in Gaza there was ""the long shadow of starvation,"" he told reporters Saturday.

""That is more than tragic. It is a moral outrage.""",https://www.upi.com/,-1

Our Best Stuff on 2024 and the Israel-Hamas War,2024-12-19,"Hello and happy Sunday. I don’t know how you’re doing in the middle of this holiday season, between preparations and celebrations, but I’m feeling a weird mix of energized and exhausted. And not entirely because of the holidays: I’m energized because I got to go to D.C. this week to see my colleagues in person and partake in some planning meetings for next year, and a little exhausted because once my plane landed back in Cincinnati (or, um, Kentucky for you sticklers), I hit the road to go collect our son from college for winter break.

The more I think about it, that’s also a good description of how I’m feeling about the coming year: energized about the opportunities we’re going to have to do good work on important topics, and preemptively exhausted about the challenges those same topics are going to pose.

I’ve been in political media for longer than I care to admit, but I can’t remember any year that presented so many weighty difficulties. The 2016 election was a journey, to be sure, but as crazy as it was, we didn’t enter the year knowing that Donald Trump would be the GOP nominee—much less that he would win the White House. Today, we’re looking at a general election that would not only be a rematch from 2020 but draw on elements from eight years ago: two deeply unpopular candidates who only have a shot at winning because of who their opponent is.

Other big stories that would normally dominate the news will inevitably take a back seat, but they shouldn’t: The war in Ukraine is grinding on. Will the West continue to stand with Kyiv? Will the winter give Russia a chance to regroup? Could the war expand beyond Ukraine’s borders and into Eastern Europe?",https://thedispatch.com/,-1
